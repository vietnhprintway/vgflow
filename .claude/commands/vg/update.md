<rules>
1. **Global-only** — update refreshes `~/.vgflow`/global npm package, not project `.claude`.
2. **Project cleanup** — stale project-local `.claude`/`.codex` VG files are pruned via `vg_uninstall.py` backup path.
3. **Single source** — Claude hooks point at `~/.claude/settings.json`; Codex skills point at `~/.codex/skills`.
4. **Honor repo override** — `--repo=owner/name` flag flows through to `vg_update.py`.
5. **Honor args literally** — use `${ARGUMENTS}`, never `$*`/`$@` to avoid arg splitting.
</rules>

<objective>
Sync global VG install to latest `vietdev99/vgflow`, then clean the current
project so Claude and Codex load VGFlow from one global surface only.
High-level flow:

1. Preflight: verify `git`, `curl`, `python3`, helper script present.
2. `--check` mode → just print version state + exit.
3. Query `GET /repos/{repo}/releases/latest` via helper → compare with `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION`.
4. Show changelog preview for versions `> installed, <= latest`.
5. Ask user to confirm.
6. Breaking-change gate: major bump requires `--accept-breaking` + shows migration doc.
7. Download tarball + verify SHA256 + extract to `.vgflow-cache/v{ver}/`.
8. Refresh global Codex skills/agents from `~/.vgflow/codex-skills`.
9. Verify/repair Claude + Codex Playwright MCP workers (`playwright1`..`playwright5`).
10. Prune project-local VG-owned `.claude/` and `.codex/` files.
11. Write `.vg/.install-target=global`.
12. Report restart reminder.

<success_criteria>
- `/vg:update --check` prints `current=... latest=... state=...` and exits cleanly.
- Non-check run: shows changelog preview, asks confirmation, either applies or exits on cancel.
- Clean merges applied silently; conflicts parked to `.claude/vgflow-patches/{rel}.conflict` with manifest entry.
- Major-version bump blocked unless `--accept-breaking` is passed AND migration doc displayed.
- `~/.vgflow` exists and points at the active VGFlow install.
- Claude Code hooks are installed/repaired at `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- Codex skills/agents are refreshed at `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.codex/agents`.
- Project-local VG-owned `.claude/` and `.codex/` files are pruned with backup.
- `.vg/.install-target` is written as `global`.
- Functional Codex mirror equivalence is verified after update; drift without merge conflicts fails the update.
- Playwright MCP workers are verified/repaired after update for both Claude and Codex (`playwright1`..`playwright5`) and stale hardcoded lock scripts are replaced.
- Graphify tooling is verified/repaired after update when `graphify.enabled=true`; missing package installs `graphifyy[mcp]`, `.mcp.json` is repaired, and `.graphifyignore` / `.gitignore` are maintained.
- Final report lists updated / new / conflict counts. When `CONFLICTS > 0` OR `gate-conflicts.md` exists, the report emits a runtime-agnostic AI directive (`▶ NEXT_ACTION=/vg:reapply-patches[ --verify-gates]`) instructing the assistant to chain into `/vg:reapply-patches` in the next turn without waiting for a fresh user prompt. Applies to Claude Code and Codex.
- Meta files (VERSION, CHANGELOG.md, README.md, LICENSE, install.sh, sync.sh, vg.config.template.md) never written to `.claude/`.
