All notable changes to VG workflow documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), adheres to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed (UX — auto-scan + state-tailored menu)

User feedback: "không nhớ nên gõ args nào đâu" — `/vg:project --view` / `--migrate` / `--update` etc. requires user to remember flag names. v1.6.0's mode menu only fired when artifacts exist + no flag passed.

v1.6.1 makes auto-scan and proactive suggestion the **default behavior** for every `/vg:project` invocation, regardless of args:

- **Always print state summary table FIRST** — files exist (with mtime age), draft status, codebase detection, classified state category (greenfield / brownfield-fresh / legacy-v1 / fully-initialized / draft-in-progress).
- **State-tailored menus** — different option sets shown per state, with ⭐ RECOMMENDED action highlighted:
  - `legacy-v1` → recommend `[m] Migrate`, alt: view/rewrite/cancel
  - `brownfield-fresh` → recommend `[f] First-time với codebase scan`, alt: pure-text/cancel
  - `fully-initialized` → full menu: view/update/milestone/rewrite/cancel
  - `greenfield` → straight to Round 1 capture (no menu — most common new case)
  - `draft-in-progress` → resume/discard/view-draft (priority)
- **Flag mismatch validation** — explicit flags validated against state. `--migrate` on greenfield → friendly hint to use first-time instead, exit 0 (no error).
- User chỉ cần gõ `/vg:project` — workflow tự dẫn dắt, không cần đoán flag.

### Files

- `commands/vg/project.md` — step `0b_print_state_summary` (NEW) + `1_route_mode` rewritten with state-tailored menus

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed (BREAKING UX — entry point flow rebuild)

User feedback identified chicken-and-egg in old pipeline: `/vg:init` ran first asking for tech config (build commands, ports, framework markers) before `/vg:project` defined what the project is. Greenfield projects had to guess; brownfield felt redundant.

**v1.6.0 swaps the order: `/vg:project` is now the entry point.** It captures user's natural-language description, derives FOUNDATION (8 platform/runtime/data/auth/hosting/distribution/scale/compliance dimensions), then auto-generates `vg.config.md` from foundation. Config is downstream of foundation, not upstream.

### Added — `/vg:project` 7-round adaptive discussion + 6 modes

- **First-time flow** (7 rounds, adaptive — skip rounds without ambiguity, never skip Round 4 high-cost gate):
  1. Capture (free-form description or template-guided)
  2. Parse + present overview table (8 dimensions with status flags ✓/?/⚠/🔒)
  3. Targeted dialog on `?` ambiguous items
  4. **High-cost confirmation gate** (mandatory — platform/backend/deploy/DB)
  5. Constraints fill-in (scale/latency/compliance/budget/team)
  6. Auto-derive `vg.config.md` from foundation (90% silent, only `<ASK>` fields prompted)
  7. Atomic write 3 files: `PROJECT.md` + `FOUNDATION.md` + `vg.config.md`

- **Re-run modes** (when artifacts exist):
  - `--view` — Pretty-print, read-only (default safe)
  - `--update` — MERGE-preserving update (covers refine + amend, adaptive scope)
  - `--milestone` — Append milestone (foundation untouched, drift warning if shift)
  - `--rewrite` — Destructive reset with backup → `.archive/{ts}/`
  - `--migrate` — Extract FOUNDATION.md from legacy v1 PROJECT.md + codebase scan
  - `--init-only` — Re-derive vg.config.md from existing FOUNDATION.md

- **Resumable drafts** — `.planning/.project-draft.json` checkpointed every round, interrupt-safe.

### Added — `/vg:_shared/foundation-drift.md` (soft warning helper)

Wired into `/vg:roadmap` (step 4b) and `/vg:add-phase` (step 1b). Scans phase title/description for keywords (mobile/iOS/Android/serverless/desktop/embedded/...) that suggest platform shift away from FOUNDATION.md. Soft warning only — does NOT block. User proceeds with acknowledgment, drift entry logged for milestone audit. Silence with `--no-drift-check`.

### Changed — `/vg:init` is now SOFT ALIAS

`/vg:init` no longer creates `vg.config.md` from scratch. It detects state and redirects:

| State | Redirect |
|-------|----------|
| No artifacts | Suggest `/vg:project` (first-time) |
| Legacy PROJECT.md only | Suggest `/vg:project --migrate` |
| FOUNDATION.md present | Confirm + auto-chain `/vg:project --init-only` |

Backward-compat preserved — old workflows still work, just with redirect notice.

### Files

- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/foundation-drift.md` (drift detection helper)
- **REWRITTEN** `commands/vg/project.md` (~520 lines — 7-round + 6 modes + atomic writes)
- **REWRITTEN** `commands/vg/init.md` (~80 lines — soft alias only)
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/roadmap.md` (+ step 4b foundation drift check)
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/add-phase.md` (+ step 1b foundation drift check)

### Migration

Existing projects with `PROJECT.md` but no `FOUNDATION.md`:
```
/vg:project --migrate
```
Auto-extracts foundation from existing PROJECT.md + codebase scan, slim down PROJECT.md, backup v1 to `.planning/.archive/{ts}/`.

### Known limitations

- 7-round flow is heavy by design (high-precision projects). No `--quick` mode in this release.
- Drift detection regex-based (keyword match), not semantic. May miss subtle shifts (e.g., "Progressive Web App" with PWA-specific tooling).
- Codex skill (`vg-project`) NOT updated in this release — Codex parity will land in v1.6.1+.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added — Codex parity for UNREACHABLE triage (v1.4.0 backport to Codex skills)

v1.4.0 added UNREACHABLE triage to Claude commands (`/vg:review` + `/vg:accept`) but Codex skills (`$vg-review` + `$vg-accept`) were not updated. v1.5.1 closes the gap so phases reviewed/accepted under either harness get the same gate.

- **`codex-skills/vg-review/SKILL.md`** step 4e: UNREACHABLE triage runs after gate evaluation, produces `UNREACHABLE-TRIAGE.md` + `.unreachable-triage.json` (same Python helper as Claude).
- **`codex-skills/vg-accept/SKILL.md`** step 3 (after sandbox verdict gate): hard gate blocks accept if any verdict is `bug-this-phase`, `cross-phase-pending`, or `scope-amend`. Override via `--allow-unreachable --reason='...'` (logged to `build-state.log`).

Note: v1.5.0's TodoWrite ban does NOT apply to Codex (Codex CLI has no TodoWrite tool — different harness, different tail UI).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed (BREAKING UX — show-step mechanism rebuild)

End-to-end re-evaluation of progress narration found 8 bugs across 4 layered mechanisms (TodoWrite, session_start banner, session_mark_step, narrate_phase). v1.3.3's TODOWRITE_POLICY softfix was insufficient because it was conditional ("if you use TodoWrite") — model rationalized opt-out, items still got stuck.

**TodoWrite/TaskCreate/TaskUpdate are now BANNED in `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:build`.**

Why TodoWrite was the wrong abstraction:
1. Persists across sessions until next TodoWrite call (stuck-tail symptom)
2. Long Task subagent (30 min) blocks all updates → Ctrl+C = items stuck forever
3. Bash echo / EXIT trap can't reach TodoWrite (model-only tool)
4. Subagent's TodoWrite goes to its own conversation, not parent UI
5. Conditional policy gets skipped by model

### Added — replacement narration

- **Markdown headers in model text output** between tool calls (e.g. `## ━━━ Phase 2b-1: Navigator ━━━`). Visible in message stream, does NOT persist after session.
- **`run_in_background: true` + `BashOutput` polling** for any Bash > 30s — user sees stdout live instead of blank wait.
- **1-line text BEFORE + 1-line summary AFTER** for any `Task` subagent > 2 min.
- **Bash echo / `session_start` banner** demoted to audit-log role only — useful for run history, NOT live UX (lands in tool result block, only visible after Bash returns).

### Modified

- `commands/vg/review.md`, `test.md`, `build.md`:
  - Removed `<TODOWRITE_POLICY>` block, replaced with `<NARRATION_POLICY>` block at top
  - Removed `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate` from `allowed-tools`; added `BashOutput`
- `commands/vg/_shared/session-lifecycle.md`:
  - Replaced TodoWrite policy section with full bug map (8 bugs) + narration replacement table
  - `session_start` / EXIT trap retained but documented as audit log, not live UX

### Migration

Existing stuck TodoWrite items will clear once a v1.5.0 `/vg:review` (or `/vg:test`, `/vg:build`) runs in the session — orchestrator no longer creates new TodoWrite items, so the status tail naturally empties as Claude Code GC's stale state at next session restart.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added — UNREACHABLE Triage (closes silent-debt loophole)

UNREACHABLE goals from `/vg:review` were previously "tracked separately" and accepted silently. They are bugs (or fictional roadmap entries) until proven otherwise. New triage system classifies each one and gates accept on unresolved verdicts.

- **New shared helper `_shared/unreachable-triage.md`**:
  - `triage_unreachable_goals()` — for each UNREACHABLE goal, extract distinctive keywords (route paths, PascalCase symbols, quoted UI labels), scan all other phase artifacts (PLAN/SUMMARY/RUNTIME-MAP/TEST-GOALS/SPECS/CONTEXT/API-CONTRACTS), classify into one of 4 verdicts:
    - `cross-phase:{X.Y}` — owning phase exists, accepted, AND verified in its RUNTIME-MAP.json (proof of reachability)
    - `cross-phase-pending:{X.Y}` — owning phase exists but not yet accepted → BLOCK current accept
    - `bug-this-phase` — current SPECS/CONTEXT mentions the keywords but no phase claims it → **BUG**, BLOCK accept
    - `scope-amend` — no phase claims it AND current SPECS doesn't mention → BLOCK accept (`/vg:amend` to remove or `/vg:add-phase` to create owner)
  - `unreachable_triage_accept_gate()` — read `.unreachable-triage.json`, exit 1 if any blocking verdict outstanding
- **`/vg:review` step `unreachable_triage`** (after gate evaluation, before crossai_review): runs triage, writes `UNREACHABLE-TRIAGE.md` (human-readable, evidence per goal) + `.unreachable-triage.json` (machine-readable). Does NOT block review exit — only `/vg:accept` enforces.
- **`/vg:accept` step `3b_unreachable_triage_gate`**: hard gate before UAT checklist. Blocks unless `--allow-unreachable --reason='<why>'` provided. Override is logged to override-debt register and surfaces in UAT.md "Unreachable Debt" section + `/vg:telemetry`.
- **UAT.md template** gains `## B.1 UNREACHABLE Triage` section: Resolved (cross-phase) entries plus Unreachable Debt table when override was used.
- Cross-phase verification reads target phase's RUNTIME-MAP.json (proof of runtime reachability), not just claims in PLAN.md — prevents fictional cross-phase citations.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (UX — stuck UI tail across runs)
- **Stuck TodoWrite items hanging in Claude Code's "Baking…" / "Hullaballooing…" status box across `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:build` runs** — items like "Phase 2b-1: Navigator", "Start pnpm dev + wait health" persisted from interrupted previous runs because TodoWrite list wasn't reset/cleared.
- **Root cause:** v1.3.0 session lifecycle banner only displaces `echo` narration tail, not TodoWrite items (which are model-only, bash trap can't touch them).
- **Fix:** Added `<TODOWRITE_POLICY>` directive block at top of `commands/vg/review.md`, `test.md`, `build.md`. Tells executing model:
  1. FIRST tool call MUST be a TodoWrite that REPLACES stale items (overwrites entire list)
  2. Mark each item `completed` immediately when done — don't batch
  3. Exit path (success OR error) MUST leave NO `pending`/`in_progress` items
  4. Better default: prefer `narrate_phase` (echo) over TodoWrite for granular per-step progress
- Companion update in `_shared/session-lifecycle.md` documents the symptom + recommended pattern (≤7 top-level milestones max for TodoWrite, echo for everything else).

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (CRITICAL — extend preservation gate to all migrate steps)
- **`/vg:migrate` steps 5, 6, 7 also had overwrite-without-diff risk** (v1.3.1 only fixed step 4 CONTEXT.md):
  - Step 5 **API-CONTRACTS.md**: `--force` case overwrote existing without preserving endpoint paths
  - Step 6 **TEST-GOALS.md**: `--force` case overwrote existing without preserving G-XX goals + bodies
  - Step 7 **PLAN.md attribution**: Agent trusted to "only add attributes" but no verification — task descriptions could be silently rewritten/dropped
- **Fix:** All 4 mutation steps (4/5/6/7) now write to `{file}.staged` first. Preservation gates before promote:
  - IDs preserved (D-XX, G-XX, Task N, endpoint paths — depending on artifact type)
  - Body similarity ≥ 80% (difflib.SequenceMatcher) — attribute-stripped for PLAN.md
  - On fail: original untouched, staging kept at `{file}.staged`, backup in `.gsd-backup/`
- **Universal rule added to `<rules>` block**: "MERGE, DO NOT OVERWRITE" — codifies staging+diff+gate pattern for any future migrate step or similar mutation command.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (CRITICAL — data safety)
- **`/vg:migrate` step 4 `_enrich_context` was losing decisions silently** — agent wrote directly to `CONTEXT.md`, overwriting original. If agent dropped or merged D-XX decisions, they were **permanently lost** (backup in `.gsd-backup/` but no automatic diff/rollback).
- **Fix:** Agent now writes to `CONTEXT.md.enriched` staging file. Three gates run before promoting to `CONTEXT.md`:
  1. **Decision-ID preservation**: every `D-XX` in original must exist in staging (missing → abort, no overwrite)
  2. **Body-preservation**: each decision body must be ≥ 80% similar to original (rewritten prose → abort)
  3. **Sub-section coverage**: warns if `**Endpoints:**` count ≠ decision count (non-fatal)
- Only if all 3 gates pass → staging promoted to `CONTEXT.md` atomically. On failure, staging preserved for user review; original CONTEXT.md untouched.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Session lifecycle helper** (`_shared/session-lifecycle.md`) wired into `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:build` — emits session-start banner + EXIT trap for clean tail UI across runs
- Stale state auto-sweep (configurable `session.stale_hours`, default 1h) — removes leftover `.review-state.json` / `.test-state.json` from previous interrupted runs
- Cross-platform port sweep (Windows netstat/taskkill + Linux lsof/kill) — kills orphan dev servers before new run
- Config: `session.stale_hours`, `session.port_sweep_on_start`

### Fixed
- Stuck "Phase 2b-1 / Phase 2b-2" items in Claude Code tail UI after interrupted `/vg:review` runs — EXIT trap now emits `━━━ EXITED at step=X ━━━` terminal marker

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Phase pipeline accuracy:** commands/docs consistently reference the correct 7-step pipeline `specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept` (was showing 6 steps, missing `specs` at front)
- `next.md` PIPELINE_STEPS order now includes `specs` — `/vg:next` can advance from specs-only state to scope
- `scripts/phase-recon.py` PIPELINE_STEPS now includes `specs` — phase reconnaissance detects specs-only phase correctly
- `phase.md` description, args, and inline docs reflect 7 steps
- `amend.md`, `blueprint.md`, `build.md`, `review.md`, `test.md` header pipelines include `specs` prefix
- `init.md` help text reflects 7-step phase pipeline

### Added
- `README.vi.md` — Vietnamese translation of README with cross-link back to English
- `README.md` — rewritten with clear 2-tier pipeline explanation (project setup + per-phase execution)
- Both READMEs now show the project-level setup chain (`/vg:init → /vg:project → /vg:roadmap → /vg:map → /vg:prioritize`) before the per-phase pipeline

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- `/vg:update` command — pull latest release from GitHub, 3-way merge with local edits, park conflicts in `.claude/vgflow-patches/`
- `/vg:reapply-patches` command — interactive per-conflict resolution (edit / keep-upstream / restore-local / skip)
- `scripts/vg_update.py` — Python helper implementing SemVer compare, SHA256 verify, 3-way merge via `git merge-file`, patches manifest persistence, GitHub release API query
- `/vg:progress` version banner — shows installed VG version + daily update check (lazy-cached)
- `migrations/template.md` — template for breaking-change migration guides
- Release tarball auto-build: GitHub Action builds + attaches `vgflow-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` + `.sha256` per tag

### Fixed
- Windows Python text mode CRLF translation in 3-way merge tmp file (caused false conflicts against LF-terminated ancestor files)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Initial public release of VGFlow
- 6-step pipeline: scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept
- Config-driven engine via `vg.config.md` — zero hardcoded stack values
- `install.sh` for fresh project install
- `sync.sh` for dev-side source↔mirror sync
- Claude Code commands (`commands/vg/`) + shared helpers
- Codex CLI skills parity (`codex-skills/vg-review`, `vg-test`)
- Gemini CLI skills parity (`gemini-skills/`)
- Python scripts for graphify, caller graph, visual diff, phase recon
- Commit-msg hook template enforcing citation + SemVer task IDs
- Infrastructure: override debt register, i18n narration, telemetry, security register, visual regression, incremental graphify
