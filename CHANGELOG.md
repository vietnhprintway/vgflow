# Changelog

## v4.26.0 — Spec stage coverage validator (Batch 23) (2026-05-15)

Closes user dogfood bug: "test bật form modal, bật xong là xong, không hề test
nhập form, save form". F1 CODEGEN-MANIFEST gate (Batch 19) only checked spec
COUNT. Codegen subagent silently produced shallow `.spec.ts` missing fill/submit/
waitForResponse/persistence assertions.

### New validator: verify-spec-stage-coverage.py

`scripts/validators/verify-spec-stage-coverage.py` — opens each spec file listed
in `CODEGEN-MANIFEST.json`, regex-checks body covers per-stage required patterns
from `LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json` declared stages per goal.

STAGE_PATTERNS dict (IGNORECASE):
- `read_before`: `page.goto(`
- `create`: `page.fill(` + `page.click(button|submit)` + `waitForResponse(`
- `read_after_create`: `toBeVisible()` / `toContainText(`
- `update`: fill + click + waitForResponse
- `read_after_update`: reload/goto + assertion
- `delete`: click + waitForResponse
- `read_after_delete`: `not.toBeVisible()` / `toBeHidden()` / `toHaveCount(0)`

Missing pattern per declared stage → exit 1 with goal_id + stage context.
`--json` flag emits structured `{ shallow_specs, failures }` for telemetry.

### Two enforcement points

1. `/vg:test-spec` — post-codegen, after F1 CODEGEN-MANIFEST gate, before
   run-complete. Catches shallow specs at codegen time. Emits
   `test_spec.spec_body_shallow` event on BLOCK.
2. `/vg:test` preflight — early gate before playwright runtime. Defense-in-depth
   for specs from prior codegen runs. Same event + exit 1.

Tests: `tests/test_batch23_spec_stage_coverage.py` (4 tests) +
`tests/test_batch23_validator_wired.py` (2 tests).

## v4.25.0 — Review scaffold + classification gaps (Batch 22) (2026-05-14)

Closes all 10 Codex review+test-spec audit findings across Batch 19 (v4.24.0)
+ Batch 22 (v4.25.0). 4 HIGH + 1 MED resolved with TDD-verified fixes.

### F7 (HIGH): MATRIX-INTENT.json deterministic generator
`commands/vg/_shared/review/matrix-intent.md:47` — matrix-intent.md only ran
`mark-step`. No script wrote `MATRIX-INTENT.json`. Receipt counts (READY 11 /
BLOCKED 0 / NOT_SCANNED 4) came from elsewhere — file missing or stale.

Fix: New `scripts/generate-matrix-intent.py` reads `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.json`,
computes per-goal verdict (READY_BEHAVIORAL / READY_STRUCTURAL / BLOCKED /
NOT_SCANNED) + writes `MATRIX-INTENT.json` with summary counts.
`matrix-intent.md` invokes generator before mark-step. Failure = BLOCK.
`review.md` must_write contract adds `MATRIX-INTENT.json` (content_min_bytes: 200).

### F3 (HIGH): Deep test-spec goal parity check
`scripts/validators/verify-deep-test-specs.py:198` — validator checked files +
emitted goal shape only. Did NOT compare against full `TEST-GOALS.md` list.
Automatable goals could be silently dropped from `LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json`.

Fix: `--check-goal-parity` flag computes set diff:
  automatable_goals (from TEST-GOALS.md) - emitted_goals - goals_with_skip_reason.
Non-empty diff → exit 1, names omitted goals. Also adds `--phase-dir` flag.

### F8 (HIGH): Lens probe skip override-debt + coverage hard-block
`lens-and-findings.md:23,151,196` — lens probe eligibility fail wrote
`.recursive-probe-skipped.yaml` + bypassed coverage. Coverage failure emitted
prompt only (didn't exit). '12 lens probes' could reduce to zero probes plus
skip marker, review still PASS.

Fix: Skip path emits `vg-orchestrator override` + `review.lens_skipped` event
with reason (logs override-debt). Coverage failure exits 1 unless
`--allow-lens-coverage-gap` set.

### F9 (HIGH): CRUD lane SKIPPED/NO_SURFACE/FAILED/PASS classification
`lens-and-findings.md:666,723,757` — CRUD findings lane skipped on missing
CRUD-SURFACES, missing kit, auth fail, or no run artifacts — all silently
continued with markers written. 'Few findings' could mean 'few probes ran'.

Fix: Explicit CRUD_STATE classification:
- NO_SURFACE: CRUD-SURFACES.md missing → review.crud_no_surface event
- SKIPPED: kit missing or auth fail → review.crud_skipped event
- FAILED: probe ran but matrix returned errors
- PASS: all probes returned clean

### F10 (MED): Separate static inventory from runtime visited counts
`code-scan.md:300,315` + `api-and-discovery.md:711` — counts labelled as depth
proof mixed static grep counts (routes/models/services) with runtime browser tour
evidence. User saw 65 routes registered, assumed deep coverage.

Fix: `review/close.md` recap template now has two sections:
- **Static inventory** (grep — routes/models/services counts from code-scan)
- **Runtime visited** (browser tour — views toured / scan files / EXPECTED)

## v4.24.1 — Hotfix Batch 19 CI fails (2026-05-14)

v4.24.0 release CI broke 3 tests:
1. `test_blocking_gate_prompt::test_leg1_emits_json_with_4_options` — F6
   changed `blocking_gate_prompt_emit` return code from 0 to 2 for
   `severity=error`. Test still expected 0. Updated assertion to match
   new F6 contract.
2. `test_codex_test_accept_step_parity` — `codex-skills/vg-test-spec/
   SKILL.md` drifted after F1/F2 changes. Curated-guard blocked auto
   regen — manual sync of CODEGEN-MANIFEST gate + run-complete strict
   block.
3. `test_review_global_paths` — F4 + F5 patches hardcoded `.claude/
   scripts/...` paths. Test enforces `${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-...}/
   scripts}` pattern for review files. Updated:
   - `review/api-and-discovery.md:1215,1229` (F4 emit-events)
   - `review/lens-and-findings.md:476` (F5 merge-runtime-map path)

## v4.24.0 — Review + Test-Spec CRITICAL fixes (Batch 19) (2026-05-14)

Codex audit found 5 CRITICAL execution path gaps across review and test-spec lanes.
All 5 findings resolved with TDD-verified fixes.

### F1 (CRITICAL): test-spec codegen CODEGEN-MANIFEST verdict gate
`test-spec.md:432,451` — vg-test-codegen Agent spawn was comment-only. Marker
`4_codegen.done` fired unconditionally. Codegen complete claimed without actual codegen.

Fix: Post-Agent gate requires `${PHASE_DIR}/CODEGEN-MANIFEST.json` on disk + 
`playwright_specs` array length >= 1. Missing file or zero specs exits 1 with
`test_spec.codegen_missing_manifest` / `test_spec.codegen_zero_specs` events.

### F2 (CRITICAL): test-spec run-complete swallowed failure removed
`test-spec.md:538` — `run-complete --outcome PASS 2>/dev/null || true` swallowed
contract-validator failures. `verdict=PASS` was written to PIPELINE-STATE 17 lines
earlier (line 523), but contract failures were hidden.

Fix: Drop `2>/dev/null || true`. Capture rc via `PIPESTATUS`, exit 1 on non-zero,
surface stderr to user. PASS verdict sequencing concern noted for future batch.

### F4 (CRITICAL): review browser tour per-view evidence gate
`review/api-and-discovery.md:1128` — browser tour Agent spawn was prose. Contract
required only `scan-*.json glob >= 1`. No per-view evidence enforced.

Fix: Post-spawn gate reads `.review/nav-discovery.json` views array, counts
`.scan/scan-*.json` files, requires `ASSIGNED_VIEWS == SCAN_COUNT`. Provenance
check via `CURRENT_RUN_ID`. Emits `review.browser_tour_evidence_gap` on mismatch.

### F5 (CRITICAL): RUNTIME-MAP deterministic merge script
`review/lens-and-findings.md:260,373` + `review/close.md:93` — RUNTIME-MAP.json
merged via prose instruction. No minimum size gate (80 bytes). Fabricated 80-byte
stub JSON could satisfy artifact contract.

Fix: New `scripts/merge-runtime-map.py` — reads each `scan-*.json`, builds
`views[]` array with `elements/actions/goal_sequences/source_scan/scan_run_id`.
Refuses to write stub when scan dir empty. `lens-and-findings.md` invokes script.
`close.md` adds size gate: RUNTIME-MAP.json must be >= 500 bytes.

### F6 (CRITICAL): blocking gates enforced resolve
`scripts/lib/blocking-gate-prompt.sh:16` — `blocking_gate_prompt_emit()` always
returned 0. 7 callers in `review/close.md` didn't branch on return code. Failed
gates fell through to `run-complete` with `verdict=PASS`.

Fix: `blocking_gate_prompt_emit` returns 2 on critical/error severity, 0 on warn.
All 7 callers (`matrix_evidence_link`, `rcrurd_post_state`, `matrix_staleness`,
`evidence_provenance`, `mutation_submit`, `rcrurd_depth`, `asserted_drift`) now
capture `EMIT_RC` and exit 1 unless `--gate-resolved=<gate_id>` set by Leg 2.

## v4.23.0 — Test execution plan enforcement (Batch 21) (2026-05-14)

User dogfood: "test không chạy theo lộ trình của test-specs đề ra".
`regression-security.md` used `{phase}-goal-*.spec.ts` glob, ignoring
test-spec lifecycle artifacts entirely.

### Fix: 4 enforcement layers in `commands/vg/_shared/test/regression-security.md`

**Task 1 — CODEGEN-MANIFEST spec list:**
CODEGEN-MANIFEST.json is now the primary spec source. Python extracts
`playwright_specs[].path` list (supports both string and dict entries,
both `playwright_specs` and legacy `specs` field names). Glob becomes
fallback-only when manifest is missing (emits
`test.manifest_missing_glob_fallback`). Empty manifest → BLOCK with
`test.manifest_empty`.

**Task 2 — TEST-EXECUTION-PLAN order + family routing:**
Reads `TEST-EXECUTION-PLAN.json` `execution_order` array and reorders
spec list to match. Specs not in execution_order appended defensively
(no orphan drop). `family` field (mobile, backend, cli, library) adds
`--project=<family>` to playwright invocation.

**Task 3 — Pre-run existence gate:**
Before playwright runs, validates each manifest spec file exists on
disk. Missing spec → exit 1 + emit `test.manifest_spec_missing`.
Closes "codegen claims spec X exists but file deleted/never written"
drift.

**Task 4 — Post-run orphan spec detection (advisory):**
After playwright finishes, parses `playwright-results.json`
`suites[].specs[].file`. Set diff vs manifest paths. Orphan specs
emit `test.orphan_spec_executed` event (WARN only at v4.23.0 —
will flip to BLOCK in v4.24+ after telemetry data collected).

### Tests added
- `tests/test_batch21_codegen_manifest_consume.py`
- `tests/test_batch21_execution_plan_order.py`
- `tests/test_batch21_prerun_existence_gate.py`
- `tests/test_batch21_orphan_spec_detection.py`

## v4.22.1 — Codex mirror sync after Batch 20 (2026-05-14)

v4.22.0 release CI failed `verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py` —
`codex-skills/vg-override-resolve/SKILL.md` drifted from source after
Batch 20 Task 4 added `--deploy-method` extension.

Regenerated via `bash scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh --force`.
verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py: drift 1 → 0.

## v4.22.0 — Deploy contract lock + PreToolUse hook (Batch 20) (2026-05-14)

Real-world dogfood feedback from PrintwayV3: different phases invented
different deploy methods (ansible vs npm run deploy vs raw commands)
because deploy method was only described in prose across multiple config
files. AI re-interpreted prose differently across runs → deploy drift.

Fix: canonical .vg/DEPLOY-CONTRACT.json per project + PreToolUse Bash
hook that blocks any deploy command not matching the contract fingerprint.

### 1. deploy-contract-init.py + deploy-contract-load.py

scripts/deploy-contract-init.py — bootstraps .vg/DEPLOY-CONTRACT.json.
method in {ansible, pm2, docker, systemd, kubectl, helm, terraform,
capistrano, fabric, custom}. Auto-infers method from build command
pattern. Idempotent (refuses overwrite without --force).

scripts/deploy-contract-load.py — prints shell export statements
(DEPLOY_METHOD, DEPLOY_BUILD, DEPLOY_RESTART, DEPLOY_HEALTH, etc.)
for sourcing. {env} placeholder substituted from --env arg. Exits 1
if DEPLOY-CONTRACT.json missing.

Schema: schemas/deploy-contract.schema.json

### 2. PreToolUse drift guard hook

scripts/hooks/vg-deploy-contract-guard.sh — PreToolUse hook on Bash.
Pattern-matches deploy-like commands (ansible, pm2, docker compose,
kubectl, helm, terraform, sudo systemctl, capistrano, fab). Blocks if:
1. No DEPLOY-CONTRACT.json — provides bootstrap instruction.
2. Command does not match contract.fingerprint_pattern — provides
   override-resolve hint.

install-hooks.sh wires the guard globally as PreToolUse Bash hook.

### 3. Wire loader into deploy steps

test/deploy.md STEP 5a_deploy — replaces comment-only deploy block with
bash that sources deploy-contract-load.py then runs ,
, . AI no longer invents commands.

deploy/execute.md — sources loader at Step 1 init block so executor
subagent inherits locked deploy vars.

deploy/preflight.md — added DEPLOY-CONTRACT.json bootstrap check.
Blocks if missing; --init flag triggers interactive bootstrap.

deploy.md — argument-hint updated with --init flag.

### 4. /vg:override-resolve --deploy-method extension

override-resolve.md — adds --deploy-method=<X> --reason='<text>' flag
for legitimate deploy infrastructure migration. Emits
deploy.contract_override telemetry + logs override-debt entry. AI then
re-runs deploy-contract-init --force with new commands.

### Tests

5 new test files. 13 new tests. All pass.

## v4.21.0 — Post-wave continuation hotfix (PrintwayV3 dogfood) (2026-05-14)

Real-world dogfood feedback from PrintwayV3 Phase 7 Wave 14:
- /vg:build waves completed but AI ended turn before running STEP 5
  post-execution. vg-build-post-executor subagent never spawned →
  L2/L3/L5/L6 fidelity gates skipped + truthcheck.json missing +
  vitest count drift (94 per-wave summary vs 100+ full run because
  Phase 7 tests landed in earlier waves weren't counted).
- User re-ran /vg:build → preflight blocked with stale markers error
  and suggested --reset-queue (DESTRUCTIVE: wipes wave commits)
  instead of --resume (correct continuation).

Two-part fix:

### 1. Stop hook enforces post-wave continuation

`scripts/hooks/vg-stop.sh` new check #4: when command=vg:build AND
\${phase_dir}/.step-markers/wave-*.done > 0 AND 9_post_execution.done
missing AND is_final_wave=true → BLOCK Stop with POST-WAVE
CONTINUATION failure. AI cannot end turn without STEP 5 running.

Prose instruction at commands/vg/build.md:315 ("MUST IMMEDIATELY
proceed to NEXT STEP IN SAME ASSISTANT TURN") is now hook-enforced.

### 2. Preflight partial-state detection

`commands/vg/_shared/build/preflight.md` Step 2 marker sanity check now
distinguishes:
- waves done + post-exec missing → suggest --resume (continue)
- waves done + post-exec missing → DO NOT suggest --reset-queue (which
  would destroy wave commits)
- Error path explicit: "These markers are LEGITIMATE — build needs to
  continue STEP 5/6/7."

Old error message still works for unrelated stale-marker cases (now
suggests both --resume and --reset-queue with semantic distinction).

### Tests

`tests/test_post_wave_continuation_hotfix.py` (4 tests).

### Closes

PrintwayV3 dogfood report: "chạy xong build theo từng wave, không thấy
chạy tiếp post build... yêu cầu chạy lại thì báo lỗi này"

## v4.20.0 — Batch 17: F6+F7+F8 UI artifact enforcement gates (2026-05-14)

Closes 3 HIGH audit findings — blueprint UI artifacts (UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT,
UI-SPEC, UI-MAP) were generated via comment-only Agent spawns with markers
firing unconditionally, allowing empty/missing artifacts to pass the contract.

**F7 (UI-SPEC gate — design.md):**
Agent spawn for UI-SPEC was comment-only (`design.md:488`). Concat loop ran
over empty `${PHASE_DIR}/UI-SPEC/` dir, producing an empty `UI-SPEC.md`.
Marker `2b6_ui_spec.done` fired unconditionally. Fix: FE-phase-aware gate
between concat loop and marker — `${PHASE_DIR}/UI-SPEC/index.md` MUST exist
for phases with TSX/JSX/Vue/Svelte tasks (FE_TASKS_COUNT > 0). Missing →
exit 1 + `blueprint.ui_spec_missing` event. Per-slug coverage check emits
`blueprint.ui_spec_partial` advisory when PLAN `<design-ref>` slugs outnumber
spec files. Backend-only phases unaffected.

**F8 (UI-MAP gate — design.md):**
UI-MAP planner spawn was `echo` only — no enforcement. Marker
`2b6b_ui_map.done` touched unconditionally. Fix: inside the FE_TASKS > 0
else branch, after planner spawn and before marker, gate on `UI-MAP.md`
existence. Missing → exit 1 + `blueprint.ui_map_missing` event. Plus schema
validator advisory (`verify-uimap-schema.py`) emits `blueprint.ui_map_schema_invalid`
on non-zero (will flip to BLOCK in v4.21+ after telemetry).

**F6 (UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT enforcement — design.md + blueprint.md):**
`UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json` was absent from blueprint.md `must_write` contract.
`emit-ui-runtime-contract.py` failures continued silently ("informational at
Stage 2"). Fix:
- `blueprint.md` must_write adds `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json` with
  `required_unless_flag: --skip-ui-runtime-contract`, `profile_filter:
  web-fullstack,web-frontend-only`.
- `design.md` emitter RC check is now FE-aware: backend-only continues with
  WARN; FE-fullstack/FE-only exits 1 + `blueprint.ui_runtime_contract_emit_failed`
  event. Legacy PASS-on-missing path still works for phases with no FE tasks.

Tests: `tests/test_f7_ui_spec_gate.py` (2 tests),
`tests/test_f8_ui_map_gate.py` (2 tests),
`tests/test_f6_ui_runtime_contract_gate.py` (2 tests).

## v4.19.0 — Batch 16: F1+F2+F9 allowlist + override CLI fixes (2026-05-14)

Closes 3 HIGH audit findings from Codex blueprint+build audit. All 3
findings were silent failures: flags documented but never reachable, or
CLI calls using non-existent subcommands.

**F1 (preflight allowlist — build/preflight.md VALID_FLAGS_PATTERN):**
`--skip-pre-test` and `--skip-contract-runtime` were documented in
`build.md:4` and declared under `forbidden_without_override` in the
frontmatter contract, but omitted from `VALID_FLAGS_PATTERN` (line 151).
Preflight rejected them as "unknown flag" before the override logic could
engage. Fix: added both to alternation + help text so typo-error message
lists them.

**F2 (override CLI invocation — build/pre-test-gate.md):**
`pre-test-gate.md` called `vg-orchestrator override-use` (unregistered
subcommand) instead of `vg-orchestrator override`. The `${OVERRIDE_REASON}`
env var was also undefined — no reason captured even if the call had worked.
Fix: parse `--override-reason=<text>` from `$ARGUMENTS` via sed; BLOCK if
empty; call `override` (canonical subcommand); drop `2>/dev/null` so
failures surface. Same fix applied to `--skip-ui-runtime-contract` branch.

**F9 (blueprint skip flags — blueprint/design.md):**
`blueprint.md` frontmatter declared `required_unless_flag` for
`--skip-form-api-map` and `--skip-ui-spec` but no blueprint sub-step
shell ever emitted `vg-orchestrator override --flag=... --reason=...`.
`forbidden_without_override` contract validator saw no event → false
negatives on run-complete. Fix: `design.md` step `2b6_ui_spec` now
handles both flags: requires `--override-reason=<text>`, parses it from
`ARGUMENTS` via sed, emits canonical override event, logs debt.

Tests: `tests/test_f1_build_allowlist.py` (3 tests),
`tests/test_f2_override_cli_fix.py` (2 tests),
`tests/test_f9_blueprint_override_emit.py` (3 tests).

## v4.18.0 — Batch 15: F3+F4 CRITICAL reviewer verdict gates (2026-05-14)

Closes 2 CRITICAL audit findings from Codex blueprint+build audit. Both
reviewer Agent spawns were comment-only scaffold; markers fired
unconditionally, producing false "reviewed" build state.

**F3 (B1 spec compliance verdict gate — post-execution-overview.md STEP 5.1):**
Per-task `vg-build-spec-reviewer` loop now requires
`${PHASE_DIR}/.spec-review/{task_id}.md` verdict file on disk. Missing
file or `verdict: FAIL` frontmatter line blocks with exit 1 and emits
`build.spec_review_missing_verdict` / `build.spec_review_failed` events.
SKIP_SPEC_REVIEW=1 escape hatch retained (unchanged).

**F4 (B4 cumulative final review verdict gate — build/close.md STEP 7.1.5):**
`vg-build-final-reviewer` now requires `${PHASE_DIR}/.final-review/verdict.md`
on disk with `verdict: PASS|PARTIAL|FAIL` frontmatter. Missing → BLOCK.
FAIL → BLOCK. PARTIAL → advisory WARN (v4.18.0; flip to BLOCK in v4.19+
after telemetry baseline). Marker only touched after verdict validated.
Emits `build.final_review_missing_verdict` / `build.final_review_failed`.

Tests: `tests/test_f3_b1_spec_review_verdict_gate.py` (3 tests),
`tests/test_f4_b4_final_review_verdict_gate.py` (1 test).

## v4.17.2 — Stop hook --check-contract guard (PR #187, 2026-05-14)

External PR from @vietnhprintway: Stop hook called legacy
`vg-orchestrator run-status --check-contract <run_id>` flag that was
removed in v4.x. Every Stop with active-run row produced spurious
`Stop-runtime-contract: 1 failure(s) ... unrecognized arguments:
--check-contract` block.

Fix: probe `run-status --help` for `--check-contract` BEFORE invoking.
No-op while flag absent. Auto-reactivates if flag reintroduced. Patches
both canonical + `.claude/` mirror.

## v4.17.1 — Codex mirror sync after Batch 14 (2026-05-13)

Patch: v4.17.0 release CI failed `verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py` —
4 codex-skills mirrors drifted after Batch 14 design-scaffold/reverse
bash-fence fix + complete-milestone hook + debug allowed-tools edits.

Regenerated via `bash scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh --force`:
- vg-complete-milestone (F1+F2: run-start + must_touch_markers + real audit)
- vg-debug (F6: SlashCommand in allowed-tools)
- vg-design-reverse (F4: AskUserQuestion outside bash fence)
- vg-design-scaffold (F4: AskUserQuestion outside bash fence)

`verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py`: drift 4 → 0.

## v4.17.0 — Batch 14: Holistic audit 3 HIGH + 4 MEDIUM closed (2026-05-13)

Holistic audit (Codex consult failed 401, fallback Grep/Read) found 12 new gaps.
Batch 14 closes 7 priority findings (3 HIGH + 4 MEDIUM). 5 LOW deferred.

### F1 (HIGH) — complete-milestone security audit was print-only

`commands/vg/complete-milestone.md` step `3_security_audit` contained a Python
one-liner that printed `'delegating to /vg:security-audit-milestone'` and
echoed `"Run: /vg:security-audit-milestone"` — never actually invoked the script.

Fix: step now probes candidate paths for `generate-strix-advisory.py` and
invokes it with `--milestone-gate`. Objective updated to reference the script
directly.

### F2 (HIGH) — complete-milestone no run-start + no must_touch_markers

`/vg:complete-milestone` had no `vg-orchestrator run-start` call and no
`must_touch_markers` in frontmatter — Stop hook exited immediately, milestone
close ran with zero contract enforcement.

Fix: frontmatter `runtime_contract` gains `must_touch_markers` for all 8 steps
(0_args through 7_atomic_commit). Step `1_telemetry_started` calls
`vg-orchestrator run-start`.

### F12 (HIGH) — roam reflector event name mismatch

`roam.md` line 253 checks `$EVENT_TYPE = "phase.roam_completed"` before
spawning vg-reflector subagent, but `roam/_shared/close.md` only emitted
`roam.session.completed`. Event name mismatch = reflector never spawns =
meta-memory feedback loop dead.

Fix: `close.md` additionally emits `phase.roam_completed` before the existing
`roam.session.completed` (which remains the FINAL Stop-hook witness per HARD-GATE).

### F3 (MEDIUM) — PostToolUse hooks orphaned (pre-existing fix confirmed)

`vg-post-tool-use-agent.sh` and `vg-post-tool-use-askuserquestion.sh` were
already wired in `install-hooks.sh` (lines 107-109). Test added to prevent
regression.

### F4 (MEDIUM) — AskUserQuestion inside bash block

`design-scaffold.md:73` and `design-reverse.md:46` placed `AskUserQuestion:`
tool-call directive inside `\`\`\`bash\`\`\`` fences — invalid bash syntax.

Fix: close the bash fence before the directive, place `AskUserQuestion:` in
plain prose, no fence reopened (no subsequent bash commands needed).

### F6 (MEDIUM) — debug missing SlashCommand in allowed-tools

`debug.md` spec-gap branch auto-triggers `/vg:amend` via `SlashCommand:` but
`SlashCommand` was absent from `allowed-tools` — permission deny silently
dropped spec-gap routing.

Fix: `SlashCommand` added to `debug.md` allowed-tools. Codex SKILL.md
frontmatter updated with `source_allowed_tools` listing.

### F11 (MEDIUM) — scope-review early-exit baseline ts not bumped

Early-exit block had comment "Still refresh baseline timestamp, then exit" but
exited before writing. Subsequent no-change runs showed stale `last checked` ts.

Fix: Python heredoc inserted before `exit 0` reads existing baseline JSON,
updates `baseline_ts` to current UTC ISO, writes back (non-fatal on error).

### Tests

7 new test files:
- `tests/test_f1_f2_complete_milestone_hook.py` — 3 tests
- `tests/test_f12_roam_reflector_event.py` — 2 tests
- `tests/test_f3_posttooluse_hooks_wired.py` — 2 tests
- `tests/test_f4_design_askuser_syntax.py` — 1 test
- `tests/test_f6_debug_allowed_tools.py` — 1 test
- `tests/test_f11_scope_review_baseline_bump.py` — 1 test (tightened assertion)

### Baseline

Full sweep: 32 failed, 2280 passed (baseline 33 fail — no new regressions).
Pre-existing failures: `test_tasklist_depth_enforcement.py` (4 tests, unchanged).

## v4.16.0 — Batch 13: Rule 2 + Rule 6 closed → 12/12 on tinbeta criteria (2026-05-13)

VGFlow scored 10/12 STRONG/BEST_MATCH on tinbeta/AGENTS.md 12-rule criteria pre-Batch-13.
Batch 13 closes Rule 2 + Rule 6 PARTIAL → **12/12 STRONG/BEST_MATCH**.

### Rule 2 (Simplicity First) — closed

**`scripts/validators/verify-task-complexity.py`**: complexity-budget gate wired into
`build/close.md` (step 12_run_complete area). Reads `complexity_budget:` field from
PLAN.md per-task blocks; compares vs `.task-diff-stats.json` (git diff stats per task).
Advisory by default (exit 0); `--strict` escalates to non-zero. Adaptation from plan:
used `.step-markers/` (actual layout) instead of `.task-markers/` (plan template);
parses `## Task T-XX` headers from PLAN.md for task IDs.

### Rule 6 (Token budgets not advisory) — closed

**`scripts/token-budget.py`**: per-task (4000) + per-session (30000) token usage ledger.
Supports `--add N`, `--check` (WARN >=80%, BLOCK >=100%), `--allow-overrun`. Atomic
writes via tempfile. Self-contained, no new deps. Out of scope: integration wiring into
existing scripts (Batch 14).

**`vg.config.template.md`** (all 3 locations): documents `token_budget.{per_task,
per_session, enforce}` block per tinbeta/AGENTS.md Rule 6 defaults.

### Tests

- `tests/test_rule2_complexity_gate.py` — 4 tests, all green
- `tests/test_rule6_token_budget.py` — 6 tests, all green

### Baseline

Full sweep: no new regressions vs v4.15.1 baseline.
Pre-existing failures: `test_tasklist_depth_enforcement.py` (4 tests, baseline).

## v4.15.1 — Codex mirror sync after Batches 10/11/12 (2026-05-13)

Patch: v4.15.0 release CI failed `verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py` —
codex-skills/{vg-amend, vg-LIFECYCLE, vg-roadmap, vg-test-spec}/SKILL.md
drifted from canonical commands/vg/ sources after Batches 10/11/12 added:
- next_command emit (Batch 10 F1)
- amend invalidation block (Batch 11 F5)
- LIFECYCLE doc refresh (Batch 10 F2+F10)
- roadmap domain/team fields (Batch 12 F7)

Fix:
- vg-amend, vg-LIFECYCLE, vg-roadmap: regenerated via
  `bash scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh --force`.
- vg-test-spec: manual sync (curated guard blocked auto-regen). Added 2
  lines for next_command emit matching F1 Batch 10 pattern.

`verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py`: drift 4 → 0.
`test_codex_test_accept_step_parity.py`: 2/2 pass.

## v4.15.0 — Batch 12 FINAL: scale infrastructure F6+F7+F8+F9 (2026-05-13)

Closes last 4 flow-chain audit findings (F6/F7/F8/F9). Scale verdict
upgrades from FAIL → **PASS (conditional on zfill migration TODO)**.

### F6 (HIGH): zfill(2) hardcoded across 14+ scripts — breaks at phase 100+

`str(phase).zfill(2)` silently truncated phase numbers >= 100 (e.g., phase 100 → "10").
Sub-phase notation `07.10.1` was mangled. Blocker for 50+ phase projects.

Fix: `scripts/lib/phase_pad.py` — shared `phase_pad(phase, width=None)` utility.
Default width=2 (backward compat). `VG_PHASE_PAD_WIDTH` env override.
Never truncates when phase >= 10^width. Sub-phase notation preserved (top-level
segment only padded). Migrated 3 heaviest-traffic scripts: `generate-lifecycle-specs.py`,
`generate-deep-test-specs.py`, `generate-interface-standards.py`.

**Remaining ~11 zfill(2) sites**: deprecation cycle TODO. Tooling tolerates
`zfill(2)` callers through v5.0; all sites migrate by v5.1.

### F7 (HIGH): no domain/team isolation for parallel multi-team work

ROADMAP.md, CROSS-PHASE-DEPS.md, and event stream had no domain/team partition.
Parallel teams couldn't safely run concurrent phases.

Fix (minimal — full parallel scheduler deferred to v5.0+):
- `roadmap.md`: ROADMAP template documents `**Domain:**` + `**Team:**` fields per phase.
- `specs/preflight.md`: new Step 3 `domain_team_propagation` reads domain/team
  from ROADMAP.md, exports `VG_PHASE_DOMAIN` + `VG_PHASE_TEAM` env vars,
  writes into `PIPELINE-STATE.json` for downstream event filtering.
- `LIFECYCLE.md`: new "Domain/Team Isolation" section documents fields,
  propagation path, and v5.0+ parallel scheduler roadmap.

### F8 (HIGH): accept/preflight didn't cross-check PIPELINE-STATE.next_command

`test/close.md` (F1 Batch 10) writes `next_command`: PASSED → `/vg:accept`,
FAILED → `/vg:review --resume`. But `accept/preflight.md` never validated
the invocation matched. Operator could `/vg:accept` a FAILED phase → ship broken code.

Fix: `accept/preflight.md` new Step `0e_next_command_crosscheck` reads
`PIPELINE-STATE.next_command`, compares vs `/vg:accept`. Mismatch:
WARN + BLOCK unless `--force`. Emits `accept.routing_mismatch_block` event.

### F9 (MEDIUM): deploy failure had no chain-back protocol

Deploy failure was silent: PIPELINE-STATE stayed at `build-complete`, no
`deploy.failed` event, no `--resume` routing.

Fix: `deploy/persist-and-close.md` failure-path block detects `DEPLOY_STATUS=FAILED`,
updates PIPELINE-STATE (`pipeline_step='deploy-failed'`, `deploy_status`,
`next_command='/vg:deploy {phase} --resume'`), emits `deploy.failed` event.

---

### FINAL SUMMARY — Flow-chain audit cycle v4.2.0 → v4.15.0

All 12 flow-chain findings + 23 audit gaps closed across 14 releases today.

| Batch | Version | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| Batches 2-5 | v4.2.0–v4.5.0 | Audit gaps 1-23 (all closed) |
| Batches 6-9 | v4.6.0–v4.9.0 | Flow-chain C1-C9 |
| Batch 10 | v4.13.0 | F1/F2/F3/F10 — auto-chain + markers + LIFECYCLE |
| Batch 11 | v4.14.0 | F4/F5/F11/F12 — amend cascade + CrossAI + review ledger |
| Batch 12 | v4.15.0 | F6/F7/F8/F9 — scale infra (FINAL) |

**Scale verdict: FAIL → PASS (conditional)**
- Condition: remaining ~11 `zfill(2)` sites migrated (v5.1 deadline).
- All chain routing gates wired end-to-end.
- Domain/team isolation schema live. Full parallel scheduler in v5.0+.

## v4.14.0 — Batch 11: amend cascade enforcement + CrossAI accept + review ledger (2026-05-13)

Closes 4 flow-chain audit findings (F4/F5/F11/F12).

### F5 (HIGH): amend cascade was informational-only

`/vg:amend` cascade analysis warned about downstream impact but never wrote
an invalidation artifact. LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json not invalidated after D-XX
change. `/vg:accept` shipped phases with stale behavioral contract — test
results from pre-amend run were still marked PASSED.

Fix: `amend.md` Phase 4 now writes `${PHASE_DIR}/.amend-invalidation.json`
with `{amended_at, changed_goals, changed_decisions, amend_session, phase}`.

### F12 (MEDIUM): accept never checked amend timestamp vs test timestamp

`/vg:accept` preflight had no comparison of `amended_at` vs SANDBOX-TEST.md
`tested` field. A phase amended AFTER its last test run would silently pass.

Fix: `accept/preflight.md` new step `0d_amend_invalidation_check` reads
`.amend-invalidation.json`, parses SANDBOX-TEST.md frontmatter `tested`
field. If `amended_at > tested_at` → BLOCK with "Re-run /vg:test".
Emits `accept.amend_invalidation_block` event.

### F4 (HIGH): CrossAI blueprint findings stranded in accept

CrossAI gap-hunt findings written to `${PHASE_DIR}/crossai/review-check.report.json`
by review lane were silently discarded by accept. HIGH/CRITICAL severity
findings shipped unacknowledged.

Fix: `accept/audit.md` new gate `6d_crossai_findings_gate`. Reads
`crossai/review-check.report.json`, BLOCKs on unacknowledged HIGH/CRITICAL
findings. Override via `--allow-crossai-findings` (debt logged). Emits
`accept.crossai_findings_block` event.

### F11 (MEDIUM): review lane had no step-status ledger

C5 Batch 9 wired step-status ledger for test lane only. Review sub-step
failures (api-and-discovery, matrix-intent) did not propagate to verdict.

Fix: `step-status-ledger.py` new `--ledger PATH` flag (default unchanged
`.test-step-status.json`). Review preflight + api-and-discovery emit
entries to `.review-step-status.json`. `review/close.md` reads ledger
before verdict computation. Symmetric with test/close.md C5 pattern.

## v4.13.0 — Batch 10: auto-chain + marker integrity + LIFECYCLE.md (2026-05-13)

Closes 4 flow-chain audit findings (F1/F2/F3/F10) for 50+ phase project readiness.

### F1 (HIGH): next_command emit on all phase closes

`--auto-chain` CI mode previously stalled at every phase boundary except
review→build because only `review/close.md` wrote `next_command` to
`PIPELINE-STATE.json`. All other closes echoed `Next: /vg:X` to stdout only.

Fix: `specs/write-and-commit.md`, `scope/close.md`, `blueprint/close.md`,
`test-spec.md`, and `test/close.md` now each write `state['next_command']`
to `PIPELINE-STATE.json`. `test/close.md` is verdict-dependent:
PASSED/GAPS_FOUND → `/vg:accept`, FAILED → `/vg:review --resume`.

All 6 phase boundaries now wired for `--auto-chain` end-to-end.

### F3 (HIGH): strict marker check on blueprint/build/accept

`verify_all_markers_strict_runid` (Batch 9) was wired to `test/close.md`
only. Blueprint, build, and accept/cleanup still used bare `-f .done`
file-existence checks that could be satisfied by stale markers from prior runs.

Fix: strict marker pattern propagated to `blueprint/close.md` (after R7),
`build/close.md` (before `run-complete`), and `accept/cleanup/overview.md`
(after Gate B). All 4 closes now reject empty/stale/forged markers.

### F2 (HIGH): LIFECYCLE.md test artifact corrected

`LIFECYCLE.md:60` listed `TEST-RESULTS.json` as Phase 6 output. The actual
artifact since Batch 1 is `SANDBOX-TEST.md`. Corrected with deprecation note.

### F10 (MEDIUM): LIFECYCLE.md refreshed for Batches 1-12

Added:
- Pipeline Artifacts Reference table (16 artifacts with phase origin)
- Strict Marker Gate section (all 4 closes documented)
- Auto-chain section (all 6 boundaries documented)

## v4.12.0 — H13: AI test introspection (per-failure detail extractor) (2026-05-13)

User feedback (dogfood on PrintwayV3 phase 6 G-08/G-31 tests): `/vg:test`
5e_regression invokes `npx playwright test` CLI which streams only PASS/FAIL
counts via the list reporter. AI sees no browser console messages, no
network failures, no per-test error stacks. After a failed run, the AI has
no way to diagnose WHY a test failed without manually opening trace.zip
(binary) or replaying via Playwright MCP.

Batch 5 (v4.5.0) fixed HUMAN visibility (headed browser). H13 fixes AI
introspection.

### Fix (two-part)

1. **Generated Playwright config always emits JSON reporter.**
   `templates/vg/playwright.config.generated.template.ts` previously emitted
   JSON only in CI mode. Now JSON is in BOTH branches (CI: `dot+json`,
   interactive: `list+json+html`). `playwright-results.json` always present.

2. **New `scripts/playwright-postfail-extract.py`.** After the test run,
   the extractor walks the JSON reporter output, pulls per-failure
   error_message + stack + duration + attachments (trace.zip + video.webm
   + screenshot paths), attempts to extract console messages from
   trace.zip, and writes `${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-FAILURE-REPORT.md` — an
   AI-readable summary that lists every failure with the diagnostic info
   needed to root-cause without invoking MCP replay.

3. **regression-security.md 5e_regression invokes the extractor**
   automatically after `npx playwright test`. Advisory mode (extractor
   `exit 0` even on missing/malformed JSON). The report is always present
   on failure paths.

### Tests

`tests/test_h13_ai_test_introspection.py` — 6 tests covering template JSON
reporter, extractor happy/empty/malformed paths, regression-security.md
wiring. All pass.

### Closes

H13 gap (dogfood-discovered after the formal 23-gap audit). Brings AI test
introspection on par with human visibility from Batch 5.

## v4.11.0 — Global-only install vg-orchestrator path fix (#185) (2026-05-13)

User-reported via vg bug-reporter: global-only installs missing
`vg-orchestrator` on PATH. Skill bash blocks called
`python3 .claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator` (project-relative path that does
not exist in global-only installs) AND hook scripts called
`command -v vg-orchestrator` (also missing — only `vg` was symlinked).
Effect: `/vg:test` preflight could not run, the whole pipeline blocked.

### Fix (two-pronged)

1. **`~/.local/bin/vg-orchestrator` CLI wrapper.** New
   `refresh_global_orchestrator_cli()` in `bin/vg-cli-dispatcher.sh` writes
   a small bash wrapper that resolves `VG_HOME` at runtime and invokes
   `python3 $VG_HOME/scripts/vg-orchestrator "$@"`. Makes
   `command -v vg-orchestrator` succeed and gives hooks a stable entry.

2. **Project `.claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator/` shim.** New
   `link_project_orchestrator_shim()` symlinks (or `cp -R` fallback for
   filesystems without dir symlinks) the project path to
   `~/.vgflow/scripts/vg-orchestrator/`. Lets the ~279 legacy skill bash
   blocks that use the project-relative path keep working without a mass
   rewrite. Guarded on `.git` or `.vg/` presence — never litters random
   dirs.

Both helpers run during `install)` and `sync|update)` cases so existing
global-only installs heal automatically on next sync.

### Tests

`tests/test_issue_185_orchestrator_global_install.py` — 6 tests covering
both helpers, install + sync wiring, and the guard on project markers.

### Closes

GitHub issue #185 (bug-auto, signature `bf4978ef`).

## v4.10.0 — Validator semantics + step content (Batch 3 / G13+C3+G11+H3+G3+G8) (2026-05-13)

FINAL batch closing all 23 audit gaps. Six validator/step-content gaps where
validators checked shape not semantics, and step bodies relied on template
strings instead of binding data.

### G13 — Lifecycle validator semantic checks (MEDIUM)

`verify-lifecycle-spec-depth.py` was shape-only. Added `_semantic_checks()`:
1. Stage verb vs endpoint method (create→POST, delete→DELETE, etc).
2. Each assertion entry must have a `source` field.
3. `step.actor` must exist in `goal.actors[]` set.
Advisory mode by default (prints warnings, exit 0). `--strict` flag escalates.

### C3 — URL validator checks result_semantics (HIGH)

`verify-url-state-runtime.py` already enforces `result_semantics` for filter
controls (checks `passed=true` + `rows_checked` int). Gap closed by verifying
the existing implementation is correct and adding tests.

### G11 — Post-codegen lifecycle conformance gate (LOW)

New `verify-codegen-lifecycle-conformance.py` validator. For each goal in
`LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json`, verifies generated `*.spec.ts` file references every
step's stage name OR endpoint path. Wired into `regression-security.md` before
`5e_regression` runs. Advisory mode (exit 0 always).

### H3 — Validator output surfaced on PASS path (MEDIUM)

Validator loop in `fix-loop-and-verdict.md` tails last 5 lines of each
validator's diagnostic output (inline visibility on PASS path) and writes
`${VALIDATOR}-summary.json` with verdict + evidence_count for structured
downstream access.

### G3+G8 — Step description from binding + discrete assertion arrays (LOW)

`generate-lifecycle-specs.py` `_step()` now calls `_step_description(stage,
goal, endpoint)` helper when endpoint binding succeeds. Per-stage formatting
embeds method + path (e.g. `POST /api/orders with sample payload from
API-CONTRACTS`). Falls back to default template when endpoint absent.
Combined with G7+G9 from Batch 1, step content is fully data-driven.

---

## v4.9.0 — Cleanup quality + subagent strict schema (Batch 4 / G1+G4+G5+G6+H10+C6+C7) (2026-05-13)

Audit Gaps G1, G4, G5, G6 (lifecycle generator quality), H10 (reflector
visibility), C6+C7 (subagent strict schema).

### G1 — Lifecycle preconditions from goal.dependencies (LOW)

`_preconditions()` now builds precondition list from `goal.dependencies`
and `infra_deps` fields. Boilerplate 4-bullet is fallback when both empty.

### G4 — Actor inference reads explicit goal.actors metadata (LOW)

`_infer_actors_v2()` reads explicit `actors:` metadata field first.
Word-match heuristic only used when metadata absent.

### G5 — Root fixture DAG from cross-goal dependency graph (LOW)

`_root_fixture_dag()` iterates all goal `dependencies` fields, extracts
`G-NN` cross-references, builds nodes+edges DAG at spec root level.

### G6 — artifact_capture reflects goal.artifact_kind (LOW)

`_artifact_capture_v2()` maps `artifact_kind` (csv-download, pdf,
screenshot, json) to typed capture entries with path slots.

### H10 — vg-reflector output persisted to REFLECTION.md (LOW)

test/close.md now writes reflector subagent output to
`${PHASE_DIR}/REFLECTION.md` as committed phase artifact.
`--skip-reflection` flag documented and supported for CI opt-out.

### C6 — goal-verifier post-spawn strict schema (HIGH)

goal-verification/overview.md strict validation: goal_id reconciliation
vs GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.json, STATUS_ENUM enforcement, evidence_ref
file existence check.

### C7 — codegen post-spawn strict schema (HIGH)

codegen/overview.md strict validation: spec_files[] is_file check,
READY goal coverage reconciliation, CODEGEN-BINDING-REPORT.json artifact.

## v4.8.0 — Cross-lane integration (Batch 8 / H7+H12) (2026-05-13)

Audit Gaps H7 (MEDIUM) and H12 (LOW) — HARD-GATE skip events and
CrossAI runs consumption.

### H7 — HARD-GATE skip directives emit events + accept audit (MEDIUM)

8+ HARD-GATE skip directives in test/runtime.md and test/regression-security.md
silently skipped steps by profile with no central skip manifest and no
/vg:accept verification that a substitute step ran.

Fix:
- emit_step_skipped_by_profile() helper added to both files; emits
  test.step_skipped_by_profile event with {phase, step, profile, substitute}
  whenever a HARD-GATE skip condition matches.
- Skip directives covered: 5b_runtime_contract_verify, 5c_smoke, 5c_flow,
  5c_mobile_flow, 5f_security_audit, 5f_mobile_security_audit,
  5g_performance_check, 5h_security_dynamic.
- accept/audit.md consumes .vg/events.jsonl, finds skip events with non-empty
  substitute, verifies substitute event present in same phase. Missing
  substitute → BLOCK.

### H12 — CrossAI runs/ findings flow into codegen context (LOW)

review/preflight.md drops CrossAI tool scan results into
.vg/phases/{phase}/review/runs/{tool}/. No consumer in test/test-spec lanes.

Fix:
- test/preflight.md scans review/runs/ subdirs after preflight steps,
  collects all tool findings into .tmp/crossai-findings.md, exports
  VG_CROSSAI_FINDINGS_PATH for downstream consumers.
- codegen/overview.md documents how codegen subagent prompt includes the
  findings path so test specs reference CrossAI signals (FE-BE drift, missing
  endpoints, security concerns).

## v4.7.0 — Deferred high-priority gaps (Batch 2 / G2+G14+C8+C11) (2026-05-13)

Audit Gaps G2 (HIGH), G14 (HIGH), C8 (HIGH), C11 (MEDIUM) — lifecycle
spec generator and review phase2a/2.8 structural gaps.

### C8 — Phase 2a proof reuse splits cleanly (HIGH)
review/api-and-discovery.md: if .contract-runtime-report.json fresh, phase2a
short-circuited and skipped interface-standards + api-docs coverage.

Fix: proof reuse only skips the live runtime probe. Interface-standards +
api-docs validators always run unconditionally. SKIP_LIVE_PROBE flag controls
only the live curl probe path. Event payload carries scope=live_probe_only.

### G2 — Per-verb stage derivation (HIGH)
generate-lifecycle-specs.py: REQUIRED_STAGES was fixed 7-tuple. Delete-only
goals got full RCRURDR with no-op create/update stages.

Fix: GOAL_TYPE_STAGES map + _stages_for_goal() heuristic. create-only /
update-only / delete-only get 3-stage lifecycle. HTTP verb inference from
mutation_evidence used as secondary signal. Unrecognised goal_type falls back
to RCRURDR to preserve existing behaviour.

### G14 — Read-only goals get lifecycle (HIGH)
generate-lifecycle-specs.py: read-only goals were filtered out by
_needs_lifecycle(). Coverage hole — no lifecycle produced for list/filter goals.

Fix: _needs_lifecycle() returns True for goal_type=read-only. GOAL_TYPE_STAGES
maps read-only → (read_before,) single-stage lifecycle. _read_before_action()
produces filter-assertion action from persistence_check field.

### C11 — Canonical url-runtime-status.json (MEDIUM)
url-and-error.md: 3 fragmented skip/waive flags (--allow-no-url-sync,
--skip-runtime, --allow-runtime-drift). Downstream couldn't distinguish
'passed' from 'not executed'.

Fix: scripts/emit-url-runtime-status.py atomic writer with state enum
{passed|drift|skipped|unexecuted|waived} + reason + flags audit trail.
url-and-error.md emits at end of phase 2.8 before mark_step.

## v4.6.0 — Review observability bug fixes (Batch 6 / H2+H6+H8) (2026-05-13)

Audit Gaps H2 (HIGH), H6 (MEDIUM), H8 (MEDIUM) — observability bugs in
review + test fix-loop where failure paths silently swallowed errors.

### H2 — FE-BE drift advisory un-masked
review/preflight.md:547 chained '|| true' BEFORE FE_BE_RC capture →
$? always 0 → 'if FE_BE_RC ne 0' warning branch was dead code. Advisory
shipped in v4.1 but never fired.

Fix: explicit set +e/-e bracket, FE_BE_RC captures real exit.

### H6 — manifest emit failure visible
test/fix-loop-and-verdict.md:969,976 used '--quiet || true' on manifest
emit calls → partial failure silent → run-complete blocked downstream
with no debug trail.

Fix: drop --quiet, capture EMIT_RC per call, emit
review.manifest_emit_failed event + stderr warning on non-zero.

### H8 — codex-spawn fix-agent failure persists
test/fix-loop-and-verdict.md:184 codex-spawn failure only echoed to
stderr. CI runs lost the signal.

Fix: persist failure to ${PHASE_DIR}/CODEX-FIX-FAILURES.json (err_id,
rc, ts, attempt) + emit test.codex_fix_failed event.

Audit reference: docs/plans/2026-05-13-pipeline-flow-audit.md.

## v4.5.0 — Test execution observability (Batch 5) (2026-05-13)

User feedback after v4.0 review/test split: regression run lost browser visibility because `/vg:test` STEP 5e_regression invokes `npx playwright test` headless by default. Previously `/vg:review` ran e2e HEADED via MCP and user could watch.

Batch 5 ships visibility controls:
- Generated `playwright.config.generated.ts` from template (templates/vg/)
- Headed/headless env-driven: interactive=headed, CI=headless
- `--headed` / `--headless` / `--ui` / `--slow-mo` flags on `/vg:test`
- `config.test.execution.{headed_default, slow_mo_ms, show_trace_on_failure}` block
- Trace + video + screenshot retain-on-failure with paths emitted to SANDBOX-TEST.md
- Reporter split: `list` (interactive per-spec progress) / `dot+json` (CI)
- Workers=1 when headed (serial watchability)

Also ships audit + Codex gaps:
- H1 fix: test-results/ deletion now happens AFTER trace/video preservation (not before)
- C10 fix: GAPS_FOUND verdict keeps traces (same as FAILED) — only PASSED deletes traces
- Traces copied to ${PHASE_DIR}/debug-artifacts/ before test-results/ is wiped

Closes user-reported gap "test thì mọi thứ bị ẩn, rất khó kiểm soát" (2026-05-13).

## v4.4.0 — Test safety: idempotency probe default OFF + cleanup (Batch 7 / H4 CRITICAL) (2026-05-13)

Audit (Codex GPT-5.5 + manual) Gap H4: 5b-2 idempotency check inside
runtime.md was auto-ON for critical_domains (billing/auth/payout/payment/
transaction). Double-POSTed real Bearer-token payloads to live BASE_URL.
Never cleaned up the duplicates. Production pollution on every test run.

Fix:
- Default OFF — opt-in via `config.test.idempotency.enabled: true`.
- Production HARD-GATE — refuses `ENVIRONMENT` in
  `config.test.idempotency.blocked_envs` (default: production,prod,live).
- Cleanup pass — tracks created IDs in `idempotency-cleanup.json`. After
  probe runs DELETE for each. Failed cleanup emits
  `test.idempotency_polluted` event.
- Skipped state observable — explanatory log line, never silent.

Audit reference: `docs/plans/2026-05-13-pipeline-flow-audit.md` H4.

## v4.3.0 — Verdict + marker integrity (Batch 9, 3 CRITICAL fixes) (2026-05-13)

Codex GPT-5.5 audit (2026-05-13) found 3 CRITICAL gaps where /vg:test
could report PASSED when reality was broken. Pipeline correctness lies.

### C4 — review READY no longer auto-promotes to test PASSED

Pre-fix: review verdict `READY` (endpoint observed + selectors resolved,
structural only) was auto-PASSED in TRUST_REVIEW mode without replay.
Structural scan became behavioral success.

Post-fix: `matrix-intent.md` splits into `READY_STRUCTURAL` (default) +
`READY_BEHAVIORAL` (requires persisted assertion evidence). TRUST_REVIEW
Step D point 4 only auto-passes BEHAVIORAL. STRUCTURAL → TEST_PENDING
forces test lane replay.

### C5 — step-status ledger overrides goal-only verdict

Pre-fix: final VERDICT computed from goal-*-result.json + priority
buckets only. Step BLOCK/FAIL (deploy/contract/smoke/regression/security)
invisible. User misrouted to /vg:accept on broken pipelines.

Post-fix: `.test-step-status.json` ledger (atomic writes via
scripts/step-status-ledger.py). close.md verdict reads ledger before
final extraction. Any step BLOCK/FAIL forces FAILED with
STEP_BLOCK_OVERRIDE.

### C9 — terminal marker gate verifies content + run_id

Pre-fix: marker-schema.sh defined hardened schema (phase|step|git_sha|
iso_ts|run_id) with verify_marker() forgery detection. But test/close.md
terminal gate only checked file existence. Empty/stale/forged .done
files satisfied gate.

Post-fix: marker-schema.sh adds verify_all_markers_strict_runid() helper.
test/close.md sources lib + invokes strict-mode verification with active
VG_RUN_ID match. Bypass requires explicit VG_MARKER_STRICT=0 flag.

### Tests

12 new tests across 3 files. All pre-existing tests still pass.

### Audit reference

Closes Gaps C4 + C5 + C9 from `docs/plans/2026-05-13-pipeline-flow-audit.md`.

## v4.2.0 — Lifecycle-specs contract richness (Batch 1: G7+G9+G12) (2026-05-13)

Audit + Codex GPT-5.5 second-opinion identified that `generate-lifecycle-specs.py`
was a scaffold generator emitting template-filled placeholders. Codegen had to
re-derive endpoints, decisions, and actor switching from raw TEST-GOAL text → drift.

Codex's verdict: *"v4.0 đã tách lane đúng hướng, nhưng generate-lifecycle-specs.py
chưa đủ chín để làm contract source. Hiện tại nó là scaffold generator."*

Batch 1 ships 3 critical fixes:

### G7 — Endpoint binding from API-CONTRACTS.md

Generator now reads `API-CONTRACTS.md` and binds an endpoint per stage via
verb-to-method heuristic (create→POST, delete→DELETE, etc.) with text-match
preference for goal-relevant endpoints. Every step now has `endpoint` field
(may be null). LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json schema additive.

### G9 — D-XX decision propagation from CONTEXT.md

Generator reads `CONTEXT.md`, extracts `D-XX` decision blocks + `expected_assertion`
field. Goals matching D-XX in dependencies/text get `decision_refs` array. Each
step gets `assertions[]` array with `{source: D-XX, check: ...}` entries. Codegen
no longer has to mine CONTEXT.md.

### G12 — Per-stage actor switching for multi-actor goals

Previously `_goal_spec()` hardcoded `actor_id = actors[0]["id"]` and used SAME actor
for all 7 stages. Multi-actor goals executed as single-actor in lifecycle.

`_stage_actor()` now resolves actor per stage based on stage semantics + goal
text. Approval stage with admin words → admin actor. read_after_create with
invitee words → invitee actor. Single-actor goals unchanged.

### Tests

9 new tests across 3 files. All pre-existing tests still pass (additive schema).

### Deferred to v4.3 (Batch 2)

- G2: per-verb stage derivation (delete-only → R+D+R, not full RCRURDR)
- G14: read-only goals get lifecycle with precondition spec

### Deferred to v4.4 (Batch 3)

- G8: discrete assertion arrays (already partial in G9)
- G11: post-codegen runtime conformance gate
- G13: validator semantic checks
- G3: step body from binding (not template)

### Closes

Audit findings (11 gaps) + Codex GPT-5.5 review (3 additional gaps: G12 actor
collapse, G13 shape-only validator, G14 read-only coverage hole).

Plan + design: `docs/plans/2026-05-13-lifecycle-specs-redesign-{design,plan}.md`.

## v4.1.0 — Codex deferred items: 4-stage contract-drift coverage net (2026-05-12)

Closes phantom-endpoint drift at 4 stages instead of 1. Codex GPT-5.5 second-opinion identified 4 deferred wirings after the v3.7.1 fix (commit `564a39a` wired `verify-contract-runtime.py` as BLOCK gate at build close). Each item reuses existing primitives, no new validators.

### Coverage net per failure mode

| Stage | Gate | Severity | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wave commit | `verify-contract-runtime` (Item 1) | warn — heads-up | `f31f6fa` |
| Build close | `verify-contract-runtime` (v3.7.1) | BLOCK | `564a39a` |
| Build close | PR-E mutation truthcheck + read-probe (Item 4) | warn — defense-in-depth | `a71c143` |
| Review preflight | FE-BE call graph (Item 2) | warn — drift hint | `4fb18fc` |
| Review phase2a | Proof reuse (Item 3) → fresh probe fallback | save 10-30s | `0145c8a` |

### Item 1 — Wave-level contract-runtime advisory

`verify-contract-runtime.py` was designed in its own docstring to "run right after an executor wave commits and BEFORE the next wave spawns so drift stops propagating" but was never wired at wave level — only at build close (v3.7.1). This adds the wave-level invocation in `commands/vg/_shared/build/post-execution-overview.md` as ADVISORY (warn-only, `|| true` safe) so phantom endpoint drift surfaces the moment wave N commits — wave N+1 doesn't compound the gap. Build close still owns the terminal BLOCK gate.

Emits `build.wave_contract_runtime_warn` event on advisory hit.

### Item 2 — FE-BE call graph advisory at review preflight

`scripts/validators/verify-fe-be-call-graph.py` (119 lines) compares FE fetch/axios calls vs BE route registrations for drift. Codex emphasized: ADVISORY only — dynamic routes (`/api/users/${id}` ↔ `/api/users/:id`), generated clients, and framework-specific prefixes produce false positives unsuitable for hard gates.

Wired in `commands/vg/_shared/review/preflight.md` at end of `0_parse_and_validate`. Auto-detects FE root (`src/` → `frontend/` → repo root) and BE root (`server/` → `backend/` → `api/` → repo root) with graceful fallback. Emits `review.fe_be_drift_warn` event with diagnostic in `${PHASE_DIR}/.tmp/fe-be-call-graph-advisory.diag`. V4.0 discovery-only review model fits the "report what you find" advisory contract.

### Item 3 — phase2a proof-artifact fallback

Build close `verify-contract-runtime` gate (v3.7.1) now emits `.contract-runtime-report.json` proof + `evidence-manifest` entry on success. Review `phase2a_api_contract_probe` step (in `api-and-discovery.md`) checks the proof's freshness via `verify-artifact-freshness.py`:

- Fresh (creator_run_id matches current run) → SKIP fresh runtime probe, copy proof → `.api-contract-probe.json`, mark step done.
- Stale or missing → fall back to fresh probe (existing `review-api-contract-probe.py` path).

Emits `review.phase2a_proof_reused` event on reuse. Saves 10-30s per phase when build proof valid.

### Item 4 — PR-E read-endpoint light probe

PR-E API truthcheck (in build close) covered only mutation goals with FIXTURES. Read endpoints (GET) + endpoints declared in API-CONTRACTS.md but unmapped to a goal slipped through to review step 5b runtime fail. This adds a LIGHT probe after the mutation truthcheck:

- Parse `API-CONTRACTS.md` for `## METHOD /path` headers.
- For each endpoint: `curl -sS -w %{http_code} --max-time 2 -X METHOD URL` with path params replaced by `1`.
- Verdict per endpoint: `missing` (404), `ok` (any other code), `unreachable` (timeout/err).
- ADVISORY — emits `build.pr_e_read_probe_completed` with `missing_count`. Does NOT block.

Defense-in-depth: phantom endpoints already caught by static `verify-contract-runtime` gate, but this catches cases where operator used `--skip-contract-runtime` override.

### Tests

22 new tests across 5 files — all pass:

- `tests/test_build_close_contract_runtime_gate.py` (v3.7.1 — pre-v4.1.0 baseline, 6 tests)
- `tests/test_build_wave_contract_runtime_advisory.py` (Item 1, 3 tests)
- `tests/test_review_preflight_fe_be_advisory.py` (Item 2, 4 tests)
- `tests/test_review_phase2a_proof_fallback.py` (Item 3, 4 tests)
- `tests/test_build_pr_e_read_endpoint_coverage.py` (Item 4, 5 tests)

### Closes

Codex GPT-5.5 review (consult session in v3.7.1 ship). Codex's punch quote: "Bạn đang thêm gate vì không tin gate cũ, thay vì sửa chỗ nối bị hở." Original 4-gate proposal challenged as over-engineered. Codex's lighter design: wire 7 existing primitives (verify-contract-runtime, verify-fe-be-call-graph, extract-be-route-registry, extract-fe-api-calls, verify-workflow-evidence, test_review_api_contract_probe, test_contract_runtime_verify) — zero new scripts.

## v4.0.0 — Pipeline refactor (BREAKING) (2026-05-12)

**Pipeline order change:**
- Old: `specs → scope → blueprint → build → test-spec → review → test → accept`
- New: `specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test-spec → test → accept`

**Ownership moves:**
- `/vg:review` → discovery-only (browser nav + RUNTIME-MAP + matrix INTENT). Phase 3 fix-loop + Phase 4 matrix verdict REMOVED.
- `/vg:test-spec` → owns codegen. Spawns `vg-test-codegen` subagent (was in `/vg:test` STEP 5). Adds lens smart-routing per `goal_type` + Step 4.5 `npx playwright --list` self-review.
- `/vg:test` → owns fix-loop + matrix verdict (4-state final). Adds user-confirm gate before auto-fix (A: auto, B: manual, C: skip+debt).

**New flags:**
- `/vg:phase --skip-test` — stop after test-spec
- `/vg:phase --skip-codegen` — test-spec docs only, no `.spec.ts`

**New subagent:** `vg-test-fixer` — fix failing tests, max 3 retry per goal, HARD-GATE edits only `src/` + `tests/e2e/lifecycle/`.

**File relocations:**
- `commands/vg/_shared/review/fix-loop-and-goals.md` → `commands/vg/_shared/test/fix-loop-and-verdict.md`
- Marker rename: `phase3_fix_loop` → `step5_fix_loop`
- Marker rename: `phase4_goal_comparison` → `step7_matrix_verdict`
- New marker: `phase2.5_matrix_intent` (review)
- New marker: `4_codegen` + `4_self_review` (test-spec)

**Codex parity:** 4 mirrors regenerated (`vg-review`, `vg-test-spec`, `vg-test`, `vg-phase`). Strict structural equivalence enforced via `verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py` (62 pairs).

**Migration impact:**
- In-flight phases pre-`build` → no impact
- In-flight phases at `review` (v3.7.2 logic) → finish with v3.7.2 logic 1 last time, next phase uses v4.0
- In-flight phases at `test` (v3.7.2 codegen) → finish with v3.7.2 logic 1 last time

**Rollback:** `git revert <v4.0.0-commit>` + run `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh --force`.

**Test regression baseline:** 222 failed / 819 passed (identical to v3.7.2 baseline — no new failures introduced).

## v3.7.2 — sync global-only + review auto-chain prompt (2026-05-12)

### Feat — `/vg:review` Option A auto-chain prompt (commit 5bd3fdb)

After `/vg:review` `run-complete` succeeds, the skill reads `PIPELINE-STATE.next_command` (written by PR #183 diagnostic surface) and offers the operator a 3-choice prompt instead of forcing copy-paste:

- **Chain** — AI invokes suggested skill via `Skill` tool (e.g. `/vg:test-spec 6 --regen`)
- **Skip** — print suggested commands as plain text, exit normally
- **Inspect** — show diagnostic detail (`deep-test-specs-review.json`, matrix, recent events)

Flag overrides:
- `--auto-chain` — skip prompt, AI auto-invokes suggested skill (CI / headless mode)
- `--no-chain` — skip prompt + exit (operator opt-out for this run)

Preserves operator sovereignty (explicit consent before chaining skills that modify code like `/vg:debug` or burn tokens like `/vg:test-spec --regen`). On BLOCK verdict, also offers `retry_command` path. Skill dispatch contract: parse `/vg:test-spec 6 --regen` → `Skill(skill="vg:test-spec", args="6 --regen")`. 8/8 regression tests pass.

### Fix — `sync.sh` rewritten as global-only refresh (#184)

`sync.sh` simplified from 721 → 128 lines. Single contract: regenerate Codex skills, install global Claude/Codex hooks, prune project-local VG files, write `.vg/.install-target=global`. Matches PR #177 global-only install topology.

- `/vg:sync` and Codex `vg-sync` docs updated to share the same global-only contract.
- Generated Codex HARD-GATE-CODEX marker blocks for specs/field-test (full sync regen clean).
- Regression tests: sync `--check`, stale project-local VG surface prune, deprecated no-op flag, source-repo self-prune protection.
- `--verify` + `--check` pass; DEV_ROOT-targeted sync to PrintwayV3 verified clean.

## v3.7.1 — contract drift hardening + review diagnostic + global wiring (2026-05-12)

Three independent fixes landed:

### Fix — wire verify-contract-runtime as BLOCK gate at build close (Codex finding)

Codex GPT-5.5 second-opinion review challenged a 4-gate proposal as over-engineered. Repo already had `scripts/validators/verify-contract-runtime.py` (378 lines, B7.2 / OHOK gap A2 — "phantom endpoints declared in contract, never implemented"). Registry severity was `warn` and the validator was **never invoked** in build close — dead code at harness level.

The "phantom endpoint declared but not implemented" failure mode previously surfaced only at review step 5b curl — 1+ hours after the wave committed. Cost ~5s catch at build close vs 1+ hour at review.

- `registry.yaml` severity promoted `warn` → `block` for contract-runtime.
- `close.md` invokes validator BEFORE PR-E runtime truthcheck (cheap static check first, slow runtime probe second).
- `--skip-contract-runtime` flag added with `--override-reason` debt-emit convention matching `--skip-truthcheck`.
- Emits `build.contract_runtime_blocked` event on block.

Codex's lighter design: 1 wiring + 1 policy change instead of 4 new gates. (commit 564a39a)

### Fix — review diagnostic surface for missing deep test-spec lane (#183)

When lifecycle/test-spec artifacts are missing or shallow, review now writes a block diagnostic with concrete next commands instead of failing opaque. Records `PIPELINE-STATE.next_command=/vg:test-spec {phase}`, `retry_command=/vg:review {phase} --mode=full --force`, and emits `review.deep_test_spec_blocked` telemetry.

- Review preflight resolves validators from global `~/.vgflow` when project-local `.claude/scripts` pruned.
- Extends `review-block-diagnostic.py` to classify deep test-spec / lifecycle / fixture / execution-plan gaps.
- Codex-skills mirror regenerated (95+ skill files refreshed). (commit d885db9)

### Fix — global Claude VG command wiring (#182)

- Links `~/.claude/commands/vg` to `~/.vgflow/commands/vg` during install/update.
- Ensures `vg` CLI reachable from `~/.local/bin` when no `vg` on PATH.
- Includes missing hook scripts in executable checks.
- Regression tests for global Claude command wiring + doctor output. (commit 9cb2ed1)

## v3.7.0 — /vg:field-test new skill (2026-05-11)

User-driven field-test capture distinct from AI-auto /vg:roam. Human roams the deployed app in an MCP Playwright browser via a floating Start/Stop/Mark overlay; AI silently captures browser console + network + clicks + nav chain + per-Mark notes + correlated API server log tails. On Stop, an analyzer subagent produces `FIELD-REPORT.md` and appends entries to `.vg/KNOWN-ISSUES.json`.

### Architecture

- 14 new files under `scripts/field-test/`, `commands/vg/field-test.md`, `.claude/` mirrors, `agents/vg-field-test-analyzer/`, `schemas/field-test-session.v1.json`, `codex-skills/vg-field-test/`.
- Sync via `browser_evaluate` state polling — NOT `browser_console_messages` (snapshot-replay reader that would duplicate marks).
- Per-source API log tails redact at capture time via `redact-stream.py` (closes the disk-exposure window v1 plan left open).
- Atomic lock via `mkdir .vg/field-test/.active` (not TOCTOU `echo > .active`).
- Cross-platform timestamps via `prefix-iso.py` Python wrapper (replaces GNU `date %3N`).
- `MARKER_TO_AUTO_EVENT` extension: `("field-test", "complete")` → `field_test.session_completed`.
- SPA full-reload detection: `reload_epoch` K→0 transition forces re-inject + `last_consumed=0` reset.
- 3-strike tail respawn loop with signal-aware exit-code branching (`rc=0` or `rc>128` = no respawn).

### Privacy

- Default redaction covers `password|token|secret|api[_-]?key|email|phone` + Bearer JWT + Authorization header.
- Multi-form regex: `key=value`, `key: value`, JSON body `"key":"value"`, bare `Bearer <jwt>`, full `Authorization: ...` header. Hyphenated header keys (`X-API-Key`, `X-Auth-Token`) supported.
- Idempotent (re-redacting redacted output is no-op).
- Bad user regex falls back to default + warns on stderr (never crashes).
- User patterns with regex metachars (e.g. `\bjwt=([A-Za-z0-9._-]+)`) routed to full-pattern mode (no double-wrap into multi-form template).
- Screenshots NOT redacted — HARD-GATE banner warns user before session start.
- Bundle `manifest.json` records `redaction_applied` regex + `redaction_locations: [capture, build]` for audit.

### Operational helpers (v2.1)

- `check-quota.py` — per-iter size cap + wall-clock cap (force-stop on overrun).
- `release-lock.py` — stuck-lock recovery (PID-aware via POSIX `kill -0` / Windows `tasklist`; `--force` override with explicit success message).
- `_test-jsdom-runner.js` — Node-based functional smoke for the overlay (DEFAULT test path, not behind env gate per round-2 SHOULD-6).

### Severity heuristic (analyzer)

Priority order (first match wins): HIGH (5xx network OR console `Uncaught`/`Traceback`/`TypeError`/`ReferenceError` OR `level=error` — both compact AND spaced JSON forms), MEDIUM (4xx), LOW (visual-only).

KNOWN-ISSUES.json corruption-safe: backup to `KNOWN-ISSUES.corrupt-<ts>.json.bak` + refuse append + exit non-zero. Never silently wipes. Atomic write via temp-file + `os.replace` (POSIX + Windows). Dedupe by `(source, sid, n)` — re-running on same session is idempotent.

### v1 scope (post-Codex-review)

- Single capture profile (no `quick`/`deep` preset enum — deferred to v2).
- No `--resume` (deferred to v2; design promised but implementation absent in v1).
- No phase-snapshot mirror under versioned directories (deferred to v2 with explicit audit-trail toggle).
- No `--non-interactive` (dropped — user-driven skill has no useful headless mode).
- No auto-recovered crash bundle (manual triage on browser crash).

### Tests

102 field-test tests (10 task buckets) — 100 pass everywhere + 2 Windows-platform-skip for path-with-spaces edge cases that need POSIX bash signal handling. jsdom functional smoke for overlay is the DEFAULT test path (not gated by `VG_RUN_BROWSER_TESTS=1`) per round-2 SHOULD-6. Linux fixtures cover paths with spaces (`Vibe Code/Code/PrintwayV3/`-style install dirs). Tail respawn loop has a behavioral test (Linux-only) that flaps a command exiting 17 and asserts `>=3 respawn` lines + `tail.dead` marker. Boundary correlation test pins `±window` inclusion at millisecond precision (closes the `.mmmZ` vs `.ffffffZ` width-mismatch bug found during round-2). XSS regression test pins the `location.href` `textContent` fix (no innerHTML interpolation).

### Integration with PR #177 pipeline

- Codex mirror deploys to `~/.codex/skills/vg-field-test/` only (no project-local copy committed). Test `test_codex_mirror_not_present_in_project_codex_dir` pins the global-only invariant.
- `KNOWN-ISSUES.json` entries written by `analyze.py` feed downstream `/vg:test-spec` (post-PR-#177) when re-running test-spec on the same phase — lifecycle context is enriched with manually-observed defects from field-test sessions. No new orchestrator wiring needed; `/vg:test-spec` already reads `.vg/KNOWN-ISSUES.json`.
- `commands/vg/field-test.md` Step 6 + Step 7 emit `evidence-manifest.json` entries for bundle `manifest.json` and `FIELD-REPORT.md` (mirrors the v3.6.5 / #175 review fix-loop pattern for downstream freshness verification). Step 7 re-resolves `EMIT_MANIFEST` to survive subshell isolation.
- Schema `phase_goal` field accepts domain goal IDs (`G-AUTH-00`, `G-FE-ADMIN-DLQ-01`) per `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_.-]*` regex matching PR #177 `verify-goal-coverage-phase.py` rewrite.

### Closes

Internal Codex GPT-5.5 plan review (round-1 §1-§10 + round-2 MUST-1..5 + SHOULD-6..8). Plan + design v2.1 documented under `docs/plans/2026-05-11-field-test-capture-{design,plan}.md`.

## v3.6.5 — review auto-records RUNTIME-MAP.json to evidence-manifest (2026-05-11)

### Bug — Codex vg:review run-complete blocked on must_write artifacts (closes #175)

`commands/vg/_shared/review/fix-loop-and-goals.md` emitted an evidence-manifest entry for `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md` only. `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, written by step 2b-3, never received its own manifest entry. Operators reported run-complete blocking because must_write artifacts existed on disk but had no `.vg/runs/<run>/evidence-manifest.json` entries — requiring manual `emit-evidence-manifest.py` invocation before review could close.

Signature: `45c32b6c` (auto-reported by vg bug-reporter v3.6.3 on darwin).

### Fix — emit manifest entry for RUNTIME-MAP.json at Phase 4 close

Fix-loop now emits two manifest entries side-by-side:

- `RUNTIME-MAP.json` → producer `vg:review phase2b3_runtime_map`, source_inputs `nav-discovery.json,TEST-GOALS.md`.
- `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md` → producer `vg:review phase4_goal_comparison` (existing).

Both wrapped in `[ -f ... ]` guards so backend-only phases that legitimately skip RUNTIME-MAP.json don't false-block. Both mirrored to `.claude/commands/...`.

### Tests

- `tests/test_issue_175_review_runtime_map_manifest.py` — 6 regression tests covering canonical+mirror parity, producer tagging, source-input provenance, file-existence guards.

## Unreleased — global-only install + lifecycle spec depth

### Fix — global install/update leaves no project-local VG duplicates

- `vg install --global` now treats `~/.vgflow` + `~/.codex` + `~/.claude/settings.json` as the single global VG surface.
- Project-local VG-owned Claude/Codex files are removed via `vg_uninstall.py` and backed up under `.vgflow-uninstall-backup/`.
- Custom non-VG project skills are preserved.
- `vg update` / `vg sync` refresh global Codex skills and, when the project marker is `global`, prune stale project-local VG files.
- Global `/vg:update` refreshes `~/.codex` before its early exit and cleans stale project-local VG surfaces with the same uninstall helper.

### Fix — mutation lifecycle specs must be closed-loop before /vg:test

- Added `verify-lifecycle-spec-depth.py`.
- Blueprint now generates and validates `LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json`.
- `/vg:test` preflight blocks side-effecting or multi-actor goals missing actors, fixture DAG, preconditions, full RCRURDR stages, artifact capture when applicable, or cleanup.
- Test codegen now consumes `LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json` instead of inventing fixtures/actors inline.

## v3.6.4 — bugfix: /vg:update prunes duplicate Codex skills (2026-05-11)

### Bug — /vg:update left duplicate Codex skills even after v3.6.1 dedupe

v3.6.1 added `prune_duplicate_codex_skills()` to `sync.sh` step 4b — but `sync.sh` is NOT the path operators use day-to-day. `/vg:update` runs its own merge pipeline (`commands/vg/_shared/update/{fetch-and-merge,rotate-and-repair,sync-and-report}.md`) and never calls `sync.sh`. So even after the v3.6.1 fix, anyone running `/vg:update` (not `sync.sh`) still saw vgflow flows listed twice in the Codex picker — once from `~/.codex/skills/`, once from `<project>/.codex/skills/`.

User reproduction: *"đã chạy update, code install của codex không xoá các flow của VG codex trong project đang hiện hành"* (ran update, Codex install code doesn't delete VG codex flows in current project).

### Fix — dedupe pass in /vg:update step 8_sync_codex

`commands/vg/_shared/update/sync-and-report.md` step 8_sync_codex now adds a marker-driven dedupe block AFTER both project + global deploy phases complete. Resolution rule mirrors `sync.sh`:

| `.vg/.install-target` marker | Pruned directory |
|---|---|
| `project` | `~/.codex/skills/<vgflow-name>/` (global side) |
| `global` | `<project>/.codex/skills/<vgflow-name>/` (project side) |
| absent | default to project (v3.0.0 architecture: global is canonical) |

The prune helper iterates over `${CODEX_SOURCE}/codex-skills` to enumerate vgflow-owned skill names, then deletes the matching directory from the losing side. Non-vgflow skills in the same `.codex/skills/` tree are untouched.

Gated on `PROJECT_CODEX_HAS_VGFLOW=1 && GLOBAL_CODEX_HAS_VGFLOW=1` — if only one side is populated, there's nothing to dedupe and the block silently skips. Runs BEFORE `verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py` so the mirror-verify pass sees a clean state.

### Test coverage
5 tests in `tests/test_v3_6_4_vg_update_codex_dedupe.py`:
- dedupe block present + helper function declared
- case statement handles `project` / `global` / unset marker states
- correct prune direction for each marker value
- gates on both PROJECT + GLOBAL flags
- order: dedupe runs AFTER deploy summary, BEFORE mirror-verify
- canonical/mirror byte-identity

### Compatibility
- Single-sided installs (only global OR only project) unaffected — dedupe block early-returns.
- Operators on `/vg:update` see `Codex dedupe (global-side): pruned N duplicate skill dir(s) from <path>` on first repair run, then no-op on subsequent updates.
- `sync.sh` users continue to use the v3.6.1 prune path (functionally equivalent, different code path).

## v3.6.3 — tests: Windows bash path normalization + LIFECYCLE.md mirror (2026-05-11)

### Bug — 43 tests failed locally on Windows; CI Linux passed

Tests using `subprocess.run(["bash", str(Path)], ...)` to exercise hook + sync scripts fell through to WSL bash on Windows. WSL bash receives `D:\Workspace\...` (or even `D:/Workspace/...`) and reports `No such file or directory`. Same code passed Linux CI because there's no WSL launcher in the way.

### Fix — autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py`

Two patches:
1. `_find_git_bash()` discovers `C:/Program Files/Git/bin/bash.exe` (and common alternates). When `subprocess.run(["bash", ...])` is invoked, replace `"bash"` with the Git Bash absolute path so WSL is bypassed.
2. `_bash_path()` converts backslash paths to forward-slash form (Path.as_posix()) so Git Bash doesn't interpret `\W`, `\M` as escape sequences.

Autouse fixture wraps `subprocess.run` + `subprocess.Popen` via monkeypatch — pass-through on Unix, transparent rewrite on Windows. Zero per-test changes needed.

### Result
Full suite went from **43 failures → 25 failures** on Windows. Remaining 25 are environmental (require `.vg/.evidence-key`, active run state, etc) — separate issue from path mangling. CI Linux continues to pass.

### Plus — `commands/vg/LIFECYCLE.md` mirror sync

`tests/test_v2_86_tier1_docs.py::test_mirror_byte_identity[lifecycle]` was failing because v3.6.1 edited `commands/vg/LIFECYCLE.md` (description quote-style fix) without propagating to `.claude/commands/vg/LIFECYCLE.md` mirror. Synced both sides; mirror byte-identity restored.

### Compatibility
- Unix/macOS: zero behavior change (fixture is no-op).
- Windows: tests now find Git Bash + work with absolute paths. If Git Bash isn't installed at the standard locations, `_find_git_bash()` returns None and behavior falls back to the pre-fix state.
- No production code touched; pure test-infrastructure change.

## v3.6.2 — followup: generator preserve curated content, /vg:update chmod hooks (2026-05-11)

### Bug 1 — generator `--force` wipes Codex-curated content

CI run 25637574359 failed on the v3.6.1 commit with:
```
AssertionError: vg-build: missing <HARD-GATE-CODEX> reminder block (v2.65.0 A9)
AssertionError: vg-review: missing manual mark-step calls for 4/4 HARD markers
... (×7 skills)
```

Cause: `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh --force` regenerated 14 codex-skills/*/SKILL.md with default `adapter_mode=generic`, which strips and rewrites everything between frontmatter and source body. The HARD-GATE-CODEX reminder blocks + explicit `mark-step` enumerations added by commit 765e9e5 (A9 Codex parity work) lived in that region and were lost.

Fix (v3.6.2):
- `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh` adds `target_has_curated_codex_content()` detector that returns true when target SKILL.md contains `HARD-GATE-CODEX` marker OR ≥8 `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines (A9 enumeration heuristic).
- `write_codex_skill()` checks the detector BEFORE overwriting. If curated content detected, refuse the regen and log `Skipped (curated content detected): <name> — use --force-overwrite-curated to override`. Operator must explicitly opt in via the new flag.
- New CLI flag `--force-overwrite-curated` (implies `--force`) for intentional curated-content rewrites.

Result: a future `--force` regen for unrelated changes (e.g. v3.6.1's vg-LIFECYCLE YAML fix) no longer wipes the A9 work.

### Bug 2 — `/vg:update` did not chmod hook scripts after merge

v3.6.1 fixed `sync.sh` chmod for fresh installs, but `/vg:update` runs its own merge pipeline (`commands/vg/_shared/update/{fetch-and-merge,rotate-and-repair}.md`) that does NOT call `sync.sh`. Existing macOS/Linux installs ran `/vg:update`, got new `.sh` hook files merged from git, and saw the Stop hook fail with `Permission denied` because the merged files lacked `+x`.

Fix: `commands/vg/_shared/update/rotate-and-repair.md` step `7b_repair_hooks` now runs the same `chmod +x` set as `sync.sh` BEFORE invoking `install-hooks.sh`. Covers:
- `.claude/scripts/hooks/*.sh`
- `.claude/scripts/hooks/*.py`
- `.claude/scripts/*.{sh,py}`
- `.claude/scripts/validators/*.py`
- `.claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator/*.py`
- `.claude/scripts/lib/*.py`
- `.claude/scripts/blueprint/*.py`
- `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/*.sh`

### Test coverage
6 tests in `tests/test_v3_6_2_followup.py`:
- generator declares curated-content detector (5 content checks)
- write_codex_skill skips curated targets unless override flag
- CLI accepts `--force-overwrite-curated`
- rotate-and-repair.md chmods 8 hook script categories
- chmod runs BEFORE `install-hooks.sh` invocation
- canonical/mirror byte-identity for rotate-and-repair.md
- Linux-only functional smoke: regen with curated source produces zero diff

### Compatibility
- Operators running `--force` to refresh non-curated skills work unchanged (clean targets regenerate).
- Operators who genuinely want to wipe curated content can pass `--force-overwrite-curated` (logged in stderr for audit).
- `/vg:update` from any pre-v3.6.2 install repairs hook permissions in one pass alongside the existing settings.json refresh.

## v3.6.1 — bugfix: vg-LIFECYCLE YAML, Stop hook permission, Codex skill duplicates (2026-05-11)

### Bug 1 — vg-LIFECYCLE/SKILL.md frontmatter invalid YAML

Codex CLI on every machine that ran `/vg:update` after v3.0.x rejected:
```
~/.codex/skills/vg-LIFECYCLE/SKILL.md: invalid YAML: did not find expected
key at line 2 column 192, while parsing a block mapping
<project>/.codex/skills/vg-LIFECYCLE/SKILL.md: same error
```

Root cause: `commands/vg/LIFECYCLE.md` description referenced the canonical phrase as `"where am I in the pipeline"` (double quotes inside the description scalar). `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh` wrapped the description in YAML double quotes without escaping, producing `description: "VG ... canonical "where am I" reference."` — invalid YAML.

Fix:
- `commands/vg/LIFECYCLE.md` — embedded phrase switched to single quotes (`'where am I in the pipeline'`). Source-side defensive change.
- `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh` `write_codex_skill()` — bash parameter expansion `${description//\\/\\\\}` then `${description_yaml//\"/\\\"}` escapes both backslash and double-quote before YAML emission. Future source drift can no longer reintroduce the bug.

### Bug 2 — Stop hook `Permission denied` on macOS

On freshly synced macOS projects, every Claude Code session ended with:
```
Stop hook error: Failed with non-blocking status code:
/bin/sh: <project>/.claude/scripts/hooks/vg-stop.sh: Permission denied
```

Root cause: `sync.sh` chmod block for hooks was nested inside `if [ -d "$SCRIPT_DIR/agents" ]` — installs without custom `agents/` directory left every `.claude/scripts/hooks/*.sh` non-executable. Claude Code's Stop hook fell back to `/bin/sh <path>` which respected POSIX execute bits and refused.

Fix: `sync.sh` chmod block lifted to top level, runs unconditionally when `MODE_CHECK=false`. Also added `chmod +x` for `*.py` hook files (vg-run-bash-hook.py is invoked by Stop hook on Windows + needs the bit on Unix too).

### Bug 3 — Codex picker duplicates every `vg-*` skill

When a project had been synced once with `--global-codex` and then again with default flags, both `~/.codex/skills/vg-accept/` and `<project>/.codex/skills/vg-accept/` ended up populated. Codex's skill picker reads BOTH directories and concatenates results, so every `$vg-` autocomplete showed `vg-accept` × 2, `vg-amend` × 2, … User couldn't tell which was authoritative.

Fix: `sync.sh` adds new step **4b. Dedupe Codex skills** invoking `prune_duplicate_codex_skills()` after both deploy phases. Resolution rule:

| `.vg/.install-target` marker | Action |
|---|---|
| `project` | Prune `~/.codex/skills/<name>` for any name we own (project-local install wins) |
| `global` | Prune `<project>/.codex/skills/<name>` (global install wins) |
| absent / unknown | Default to pruning project copy (matches v3.0.0 architecture) |

Idempotent. Operators on `/vg:update` will see `PRUNED N duplicate Codex skill dirs from <path>` on first repair run, then no-op thereafter.

### Test coverage
11 tests across two new files, all pass:
- `tests/test_v3_6_1_skill_yaml_validity.py` (4 tests): every codex-skills SKILL.md parses; vg-LIFECYCLE description survives load; generator has escape logic; source LIFECYCLE.md has no unescaped `"` inside description.
- `tests/test_v3_6_1_sync_fixes.py` (7 tests): chmod hooks block runs unconditionally; chmod covers .py too; prune function exists; step 4b wired; marker-aware branching; LIFECYCLE.md description hygiene; generator escape pattern present.

### Compatibility
- `/vg:update` from any pre-v3.6.1 install repairs both bugs in one pass: regenerates SKILL.md (fixes Bug 1), chmods hooks (fixes Bug 2), prunes duplicate skill dirs (fixes Bug 3).
- No schema changes, no flag changes, no breaking changes to existing workflows.

## v3.6.0 — Issue #173 Stage 6 / #169: Codex adapter telemetry parity (2026-05-11)

### Bug — Codex skipped lifecycle event emission, forced manual repair

GitHub Issue #169 (`gate_loop sig 2fabd531`): Codex `vg-review` Phase 6 run-complete blocked because Codex adapter did NOT auto-emit `phase3d_5_qa_checker` + `review.completed` + `recursive_probe` telemetry. Operator had to manually inject events via raw db writes before the contract validator would accept the run.

Root cause: the markdown command bodies (e.g. `commands/vg/_shared/review/close.md`) ended with explicit bash blocks:
```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" .claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator emit-event "review.completed" --payload "..."
```
Claude's bash sandbox + step-active gates kept these blocks visible and reliable. Codex's runtime tended to skip them when context pressure rose — the marker file got touched (via `mark-step`) but the matching lifecycle event never landed.

This is **#173 acceptance criterion E**:
> *Codex/Claude adapters should not require manual telemetry repair. If events are missing: emit mandatory lifecycle events automatically from step markers, or fail with one exact repair command.*

### Fix — two layers, adapter-agnostic

**Layer 1 (proactive) — `mark-step` auto-emits lifecycle events:**

`scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__.py` now declares `MARKER_TO_AUTO_EVENT`:

| (namespace, step_name) | Event auto-emitted |
|---|---|
| `(build, complete)` | `build.completed` |
| `(review, complete)` | `review.completed` |
| `(test, complete)` | `test.completed` |
| `(accept, complete)` | `accept.completed` |
| `(blueprint, complete)` | `blueprint.completed` |
| `(deploy, complete)` | `deploy.completed` |
| `(next, complete)` | `next.completed` |
| `(review, phase3d_5_qa_checker)` | `review.qa_check_completed` |
| `(review, phase2_5_recursive_lens_probe)` | `review.recursive_probe_completed` |
| `(review, phase2c_pre_dispatch_gates)` | `review.pre_dispatch_passed` |
| `(review, phase4_goal_comparison)` | `review.goal_comparison_completed` |

`cmd_mark_step()` looks up the marker, probes events.db (`_has_event_for_run`) for idempotency, and appends the lifecycle event with `auto_emitted: true, trigger_marker: <step>` payload if it's not already present. Works for both Claude (where explicit emit also fires — second call no-ops via idempotency) and Codex (where the auto-emit IS the only source).

**Layer 2 (reactive) — `vg-orchestrator-telemetry-repair.py` repair script:**

For legacy phases / pre-v3.6.0 events.db, the standalone script scans `.step-markers/` and `.vg/events.db`, identifies missing events, and emits them with `auto_emitted: true, repaired: true, source: vg-orchestrator-telemetry-repair`. Modes:

- `--check` → exit 1 if repair needed (CI-friendly probe)
- `--dry-run` → print missing events, write nothing
- `--json` → machine-readable diagnostic

### Compatibility
- `commands/vg/_shared/review/close.md` still explicitly emits `review.completed` — the auto-emit is the fallback safety net, not a replacement. Older harness installs that haven't rebased onto v3.6.0 continue to work.
- Idempotency guarantees no double-emission: if `close.md`'s explicit emit fires first, mark-step's auto-emit detects the existing event and skips.
- Legacy events.db files (phases reviewed before v3.6.0) can be repaired with one command:
  ```
  python scripts/vg-orchestrator-telemetry-repair.py --phase <N>
  ```

### Test coverage
8 tests in `tests/test_v3_6_codex_telemetry_parity.py` (all platforms, all pass):
- `MARKER_TO_AUTO_EVENT` mapping covers all 11 required events
- `cmd_mark_step` references the mapping + idempotency probe + sets `auto_emitted: true`
- `_has_event_for_run` defined
- canonical/mirror byte-identity for `__main__.py`
- telemetry-repair script exists with `--check` / `--dry-run` / `--json`
- repair script mapping matches orchestrator mapping (no divergence)
- canonical/mirror byte-identity for repair script
- `close.md` still emits `review.completed` (proves auto-emit is fallback, not replacement)

### Closes
- **Issue #169** — gate_loop signature 2fabd531 from Codex review-contract-close-missing-codex-parity-events.
- **Issue #173** — six-stage workflow hardening for UI-heavy phases. All six stages shipped:
  - Stage 1 (v3.1.0): matrix taxonomy
  - Stage 2 (v3.2.0): UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md emission
  - Stage 3 (v3.3.0): build pre-test-gate consumes contract
  - Stage 4 (v3.4.0): review route inventory hard-block
  - Stage 5 (v3.5.0): /vg:test codegen auto-route + contract consumption
  - Stage 6 (this release): Codex telemetry parity

## v3.5.0 — Issue #173 Stage 5: /vg:test codegen auto-route + UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT consumption (2026-05-11)

### Bug — TEST_SPEC_MISSING goals had no automatic next-action surface

GitHub Issue #173 acceptance criterion:
- *"VGFlow can generate or recommend exact Playwright spec-generation commands from missing test coverage."*

v3.1.0 Stage 1 introduced the `TEST_SPEC_MISSING` matrix status, but at `/vg:review` exit operators saw the classification without a concrete next command. The auto-fix routing (Phase 2f reason switch) listed `→ /vg:test ${PHASE_NUMBER} --codegen-from-goals` as hint text, but it was buried in the non-routed-reason summary and not surfaced at the canonical review-exit narration.

### Fix — auto-route at review close + codegen inputs from contract

`commands/vg/_shared/review/close.md` `complete` step now scans `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md` for rows with `Status=TEST_SPEC_MISSING`, prints the exact `/vg:test` command, lists the codegen inputs, and emits `review.test_spec_missing_routed` telemetry with the count + goal IDs:

```
━━━ TEST_SPEC_MISSING goals (v3.5.0 #173 Stage 5 — auto-route) ━━━
  3 goal(s) classified as TEST_SPEC_MISSING (no Playwright/lifecycle spec exists):
    G-04,G-08,G-12

  Run the codegen command below to generate skeleton specs:

    /vg:test 7 --codegen-from-goals --filter=test-spec-missing

  /vg:test consumes:
    - dev-phases/7/TEST-GOALS.md
    - dev-phases/7/CRUD-SURFACES.md
    - dev-phases/7/UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json (v3.2.0+ — route_inventory + first_viewport_surfaces + env_contract + min_spec_count)
    - dev-phases/7/RUNTIME-MAP.json
```

### Codegen consumes UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT

`commands/vg/_shared/test/codegen/delegation.md` (the spawn payload for `vg-test-codegen`) extended:

- `<inputs>` block lists `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json` as required when present.
- New `<ui_runtime_contract>` directive instructs the subagent to:
  - Cover every `contract.route_inventory[].path` with at least one route-smoke spec
  - Emit at least one computed-style assertion spec per `first_viewport_surfaces[].surface_name`
  - Hit `contract.min_spec_count.count` so the Stage 3 build pre-test-gate (`verify-ui-runtime-contract.py`) passes
  - Pin Playwright context to `contract.env_contract.cookie_domain`/`auth_host` to pre-empt ENV_MISMATCH at next review
- New `<test_spec_missing_filter>` directive: when `--filter=test-spec-missing` arg passed (forwarded from review auto-route), restrict codegen to the TEST_SPEC_MISSING goal subset by grepping the matrix.

### Telemetry
New event: `review.test_spec_missing_routed` (payload: phase, goal_count, comma-separated goal_ids).

### Test coverage
7 tests in `tests/test_v3_5_test_spec_missing_routing.py` (all platforms, all pass):
- close.md surfaces TEST_SPEC_MISSING + `--codegen-from-goals` + `--filter=test-spec-missing`
- close.md emits `review.test_spec_missing_routed` telemetry
- close.md lists 4 codegen inputs (TEST-GOALS, CRUD-SURFACES, UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT, RUNTIME-MAP)
- close.md canonical/mirror byte-identity
- delegation.md references UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json + route_inventory + first_viewport_surfaces + min_spec_count
- delegation.md declares test_spec_missing_filter section
- delegation.md canonical/mirror byte-identity

### Compatibility
- Phases without TEST_SPEC_MISSING rows: auto-route block is silent (count=0).
- Phases without UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json: codegen ignores the missing input (delegation directive is conditional `when present`).
- `vg-test-codegen` subagent is text-driven by the delegation prompt — no breaking change to existing spec generation paths.

### Stage 5 of 6 (Issue #173)
- ✅ Stage 1 (v3.1.0): matrix status taxonomy (7-reason BLOCKED)
- ✅ Stage 2 (v3.2.0): UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md emission
- ✅ Stage 3 (v3.3.0): build pre-test-gate consumes contract
- ✅ Stage 4 (v3.4.0): review route inventory hard-block
- ✅ Stage 5 (this release): /vg:test codegen auto-route + UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT consumption
- ⏳ Stage 6: Codex adapter telemetry parity (closes #169)

## v3.4.0 — Issue #173 Stage 4: review route inventory hard-block (2026-05-11)

### Bug — review missed route divergence

GitHub Issue #173 acceptance criterion:
- *"/vg:review --with-deep-scan blocks when route inventory, env preflight, lens dispatch, or lens coverage artifacts are missing."*

Pre-v3.4.0 status of those four hard-blocks:

| Hard-block | Status before this release |
|---|---|
| env preflight | ✅ already enforced — `verify-env-contract.py` (severity=block) in Phase 2c-pre |
| lens dispatch coverage | ✅ already enforced — `verify-lens-runs-coverage.py` in Phase 2b-2.5 |
| lens coverage matrix | ✅ already rendered — `lens-coverage-matrix.py` |
| **route inventory divergence** | ❌ **missing** — runtime route discovery (RUNTIME-MAP.views[]) was never diffed against blueprint declared routes |

The route inventory gap meant `/vg:review` could PASS even when:
- A view rendered at runtime had no corresponding route declared in PLAN/blueprint (scope creep)
- A contract route was never visited during browser discovery (under-coverage)

### Fix — new validator `verify-route-inventory.py`

Diffs `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.route_inventory[].path` against `RUNTIME-MAP.views[<url>]` keys. Two divergence classes:

| Evidence type | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `route_inventory_undeclared` | Runtime view absent from contract | BLOCK |
| `route_inventory_unreached` | Contract route never visited | BLOCK |
| `route_inventory_match` | All routes accounted for both directions | PASS |

Path normalization handles common runtime URL forms:
- Strip scheme + host + query string + fragment (`https://app.example.com/sites?page=2` → `/sites`)
- Numeric segments collapse to `:id` (`/sites/42` matches contract `/sites/:id`)
- UUID segments collapse to `:id`
- Trailing slash stripped (`/sites/` matches `/sites`)
- Case-insensitive

### Review wiring

`commands/vg/_shared/review/fix-loop-and-goals.md` — added `verify-route-inventory` to the v2.35.0 verdict-gate validator loop (the same loop that already runs `verify-interface-standards`, `verify-runtime-map-coverage`, `verify-crud-runs-coverage`, etc.). Inherits the loop's:
- Override flag: `--skip-content-invariants=<reason>` logs OVERRIDE-DEBT
- Telemetry: `review_verdict_invariant_failed` with validator name
- Diagnostic emission via `review-block-diagnostic.py`

### Skip semantics (PASS, no enforcement)
- `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json` missing (pre-v3.2.0 phase) → PASS skip
- `contract.skip_reason` populated (backend-only / no FE tasks) → PASS skip
- `--severity warn` flag → BLOCK downgraded to WARN

### Test coverage
13 tests in `tests/test_v3_4_review_route_inventory.py` (all platforms, all pass):
- validator + mirror byte-identity
- review fix-loop wires validator
- routes match → PASS
- undeclared route → BLOCK
- unreached route → BLOCK
- no contract → PASS skip
- skip_reason set → PASS skip
- severity=warn downgrades
- path normalization: numeric / UUID / query string / trailing slash

### Compatibility
- Phases without `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json` (everything pre-v3.2.0 + non-UI) unaffected — gate skips on missing contract.
- Override flag inherited from existing verdict-gate loop (`--skip-content-invariants=<reason>`).
- Severity config: same loop semantics (gate is block-level by default).

### Stage 4 of 6 (Issue #173)
- ✅ Stage 1 (v3.1.0): matrix status taxonomy (7-reason BLOCKED)
- ✅ Stage 2 (v3.2.0): UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md emission
- ✅ Stage 3 (v3.3.0): build pre-test-gate consumes contract (token + spec count)
- ✅ Stage 4 (this release): review route inventory hard-block
- ⏳ Stage 5: `/vg:test` codegen from TEST-GOALS + CRUD-SURFACES + route inventory
- ⏳ Stage 6: Codex adapter telemetry parity (closes #169)

Note: env preflight + lens dispatch/coverage hard-blocks were already enforced — this release verifies that with a regression-coverage test acknowledging their existence and closes the last missing gate (route inventory) per #173 acceptance.

## v3.3.0 — Issue #173 Stage 3: build pre-test-gate consumes UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT (2026-05-11)

### Bug — build closed even when runtime contract violated

GitHub Issue #173 acceptance criteria #1+#2:
- *"A Tailwind 4 UI phase fails build/review if required design tokens are missing from generated CSS."*
- *"A UI-heavy phase cannot close build with zero specs unless explicit override debt is recorded."*

v3.2.0 emitted `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json` from blueprint but no downstream stage consumed it — build still closed even when compiled CSS lacked brand tokens or zero Playwright specs landed.

### Fix — new build gate `T0 ui_runtime_contract_gate`

`scripts/validators/verify-ui-runtime-contract.py` (NEW) runs at the head of `/vg:build` STEP 6.5 pre-test-gate, BEFORE T1+T2:

| Sub-gate | Source | Default action on fail |
|---|---|---|
| Token presence | grep `apps/*/dist/**/*.css` (+ build/ + packages/) for each `required_tailwind_tokens[].class_name` | BLOCK |
| No CSS bundle found | empty glob result with tokens declared | BLOCK |
| Spec count | count Playwright/test files vs `min_spec_count.count` | BLOCK |

Skip semantics:
- `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json` missing (legacy / pre-v3.2.0 phase) → PASS skip
- `contract.skip_reason` populated (backend-only / no FE tasks) → PASS skip
- `--severity warn` flag or `vg.config build.ui_runtime_contract.severity: warn` → BLOCK downgraded to WARN
- `--skip-ui-runtime-contract --override-reason=...` → override debt logged

Telemetry events emitted: `build.ui_runtime_contract_passed` / `build.ui_runtime_contract_blocked`.

### Build wiring
`commands/vg/_shared/build/pre-test-gate.md` STEP 6.5 prefixed with the T0 gate, before the existing T1 (static checks) + T2 (unit tests) tiers. Operator sees pretty-printed evidence + JSON report at `${PHASE_DIR}/.pre-test/ui-runtime-contract.json`.

### Test coverage
10 tests in `tests/test_v3_3_ui_runtime_contract_gate.py` (all platforms, all pass):
- validator + mirror byte-identity
- pre-test-gate.md wires validator + emits both telemetry events
- happy-path (tokens + specs present) → PASS
- 1 token missing of 3 → BLOCK
- no CSS bundle → BLOCK
- spec count below min → BLOCK
- contract missing → PASS skip
- skip_reason populated → PASS skip
- severity=warn downgrades BLOCK → WARN

### Compatibility
- Phases without `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.json` (everything before v3.2.0, plus any non-UI phase) are unaffected — gate skips on missing contract.
- Operators can downgrade severity globally via `vg.config build.ui_runtime_contract.severity: warn` while migrating.
- Override flag `--skip-ui-runtime-contract --override-reason=<text>` available per build invocation.

### Stage 3 of 6 (Issue #173)
- ✅ Stage 1 (v3.1.0): matrix status taxonomy (7-reason BLOCKED)
- ✅ Stage 2 (v3.2.0): UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md emission
- ✅ Stage 3 (this release): build pre-test-gate consumes contract
- ⏳ Stage 4: review hard-blocks (route inventory + env preflight + lens artifacts)
- ⏳ Stage 5: `/vg:test` codegen from TEST-GOALS + CRUD-SURFACES + route inventory
- ⏳ Stage 6: Codex adapter telemetry parity (closes #169)

## v3.2.0 — Issue #173 Stage 2: UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT emission in blueprint (2026-05-11)

### Bug — blueprint had no runtime invariants for UI-heavy phases

GitHub Issue #173 root cause analysis: `/vg:blueprint` for UI-heavy phases emitted UI-SPEC (design tokens, typography) + UI-MAP (component tree) but never recorded the **runtime invariants** the design demanded:

| Invariant | Pre-v3.2.0 location | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Required Tailwind/brand tokens that MUST appear in compiled CSS | Implicit in UI-SPEC verbatim markup; never extracted into an executable list | Build passed even when CSS lacked tokens; FE rendered with broken brand styling |
| First-viewport surfaces (AppShell, Sidebar, TopBar, MainContent) requiring computed-style assertions | Implicit in VIEW-COMPONENTS.md | Review computed-style smoke missing or scoped wrong |
| Route inventory (all paths the phase introduces) | Buried in PLAN.md task descriptions | Review couldn't hard-block when discovered routes diverged from intent |
| Env contract (auth host, cookie domain, base_url) | ENV-CONTRACT.md (YAML) — read by review preflight but not surfaced as part of phase contract | Auth/cookie/host mismatches mis-classified as APP_BLOCKED |
| Minimum spec count (≥ goal_type=mutation count) | Nowhere | Build closed with zero Playwright specs |

### Fix — emit `UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md` + `.json` per phase

New blueprint step `2b6d_ui_runtime_contract` (after `2b6b_ui_map`) invokes `scripts/blueprint/emit-ui-runtime-contract.py`, which reads VIEW-COMPONENTS.md + UI-SPEC/*.md + ENV-CONTRACT.md + TEST-GOALS.md + PLAN*.md + .phase-profile and emits the contract.

Contract schema: `schemas/ui-runtime-contract.v1.json` (draft-07). Required fields:

| Field | Source | Downstream consumer |
|---|---|---|
| `required_tailwind_tokens[]` | Grep UI-SPEC + VIEW-COMPONENTS for `(bg-/text-/border-/ring-/fill-/stroke-)?(brand|theme)-[a-z0-9-]+` | Stage 3 build CSS-token gate (deferred) |
| `first_viewport_surfaces[]` | VIEW-COMPONENTS root-level layout components (AppShell, Sidebar, TopBar, MainContent, Header, NavBar, Layout) | Stage 4 review computed-style smoke (deferred) |
| `route_inventory[]` | Grep PLAN*.md for `/path` strings (code-fence stripped) | Stage 4 review route divergence hard-block (deferred) |
| `env_contract` | Best-effort YAML parse of ENV-CONTRACT.md `target.{base_url,auth_host,cookie_domain}`, plus `disposable_seed_data` + `third_party_stubs` count | Stage 4 review env preflight + ENV_MISMATCH classification (v3.1.0 taxonomy) |
| `min_spec_count.count` | Count `Goal type: mutation` entries in TEST-GOALS.md (flat + per-goal split) | Stage 3 build spec-count gate (deferred) |
| `acceptance_criteria[]` | Human-readable bullets composed from above | Surfaced in BUILD-LOG + matrix |

### Skip semantics
- `phase_profile ∈ {backend-only, cli-tool, library}` → stub contract with `skip_reason` populated (no FE tokens).
- PLAN has zero `.tsx/.jsx/.vue/.svelte/.css` references → stub contract.
- VIEW-COMPONENTS / UI-SPEC missing → contract written with empty arrays + warning.

### Test coverage
8 tests in `tests/test_v3_2_ui_runtime_contract.py` (all platforms, all pass):
- Schema parses + lists all v1 required sections
- Emitter exists, mirror byte-identity
- Blueprint design.md declares step + invokes emitter + emits telemetry event
- Happy-path fixture (web-fullstack + 2 mutation goals + 4 surfaces + ENV-CONTRACT) produces valid contract with extracted tokens, surfaces, routes, env, min_spec_count
- Backend-only profile → skip path with `skip_reason`
- No-FE-tasks phase → skip path with `skip_reason`

### Compatibility
- Stage 2 is **informational only**: the contract is emitted but no downstream gate consumes it yet.
- Stages 3 (build), 4 (review), 5 (test codegen) will harden gates against the contract.
- Pre-v3.2.0 callers / phases without the contract continue to work — emitter is invoked from blueprint step 2b6d which is itself optional (warns + skips if script missing).

### Stage 2 of 6 (Issue #173)
- ✅ Stage 1 (v3.1.0): matrix status taxonomy (7-reason BLOCKED)
- ✅ Stage 2 (this release): UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md emission
- ⏳ Stage 3: build validator (CSS token grep + spec count gate)
- ⏳ Stage 4: review hard-blocks (route inventory + env preflight + lens artifacts)
- ⏳ Stage 5: `/vg:test` codegen from TEST-GOALS + CRUD-SURFACES + route inventory
- ⏳ Stage 6: Codex adapter telemetry parity (closes #169)

## v3.1.0 — Issue #173 Stage 1: 7-reason BLOCKED taxonomy (2026-05-11)

### Bug — review matrix conflated test-coverage gaps with app bugs

GitHub Issue #173 dogfood report: `/vg:review` emitted `STATUS=BLOCKED` for goals where the failure was actually one of two non-app conditions:

| Real condition | Pre-v3.1.0 classification | Routing consequence |
|---|---|---|
| No Playwright/lifecycle spec covers goal | `BLOCKED` (treated as APP_BLOCKED if no other heuristic matched) | Auto-fix loop tried `/vg:build` → no fix possible (the *spec* is missing, not the code) |
| Cookie domain / auth host / sandbox env mismatch | `BLOCKED` (treated as APP_BLOCKED) | Auto-fix loop tried `/vg:build` → no fix possible (env-contract repair needed) |

Result: the auto-fix routing burned iterations on goals where `/vg:build` could not help, and operators had to manually re-classify before downstream runs.

### Fix — extend BlockedReason from 5 → 7 reasons

`scripts/challenge-coverage.py` `BlockedReason` enum now has two new values:

| Reason | Trigger key in evidence dict | Routing |
|---|---|---|
| `TEST_SPEC_MISSING` (NEW) | `missing_spec: true` | `/vg:test ${PHASE_NUMBER} --codegen-from-goals` (Stage 5 of #173 will wire codegen) |
| `ENV_MISMATCH` (NEW) | `env_mismatch: true` (optional `env_mismatch_reason: cookie_domain | auth_host | …`) | env-contract repair — surface fix command, do NOT route to `/vg:build` |

Classifier precedence (`classify_blocked()`): `env_mismatch → missing_spec → probe_error → upstream_deferred → requires_external → runtime_response_present+!matches_contract → APP_BLOCKED`.

`scripts/validators/verify-matrix-evidence-link.py` `STATUSES_WITHOUT_RUNTIME` set extended with `TEST_SPEC_MISSING` and `ENV_MISMATCH` so a matrix row using either status no longer triggers a false-positive `matrix_status_without_runtime_sequence` error.

`commands/vg/_shared/review/lens-and-findings.md` Phase 2f reason table + non-routed-reason hint Python switch updated:
- Table now lists 7 reasons with routing column
- Hint switch surfaces the new commands (`/vg:test ... --codegen-from-goals` for TEST_SPEC_MISSING, env-contract repair text for ENV_MISMATCH)

### Test coverage
9 tests in `tests/test_blocked_taxonomy.py` (all platforms, all pass):
- enum has 7 reasons (was 5)
- classifier returns TEST_SPEC_MISSING / ENV_MISMATCH for the new evidence keys
- env_mismatch and missing_spec dominate other heuristics (precedence guard)
- review.md routing surfaces both new reason names
- matrix-evidence-link STATUSES_WITHOUT_RUNTIME contains both
- canonical / `.claude/` mirror byte-identity for both modified scripts

### Compatibility
Backwards-compatible. Existing 5-reason classification paths unchanged — TEST_SPEC_MISSING / ENV_MISMATCH only fire when the evidence dict includes `missing_spec: true` or `env_mismatch: true`. Pre-v3.1.0 callers that don't set those keys keep the old 5-way routing.

### Stage 1 of 6 (Issue #173)
This release ships the **foundational taxonomy** — Stage 1 of the 6-stage plan:
- ✅ Stage 1 (this release): matrix status taxonomy
- ⏳ Stage 2: UI-RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md emission in blueprint for UI-heavy phases
- ⏳ Stage 3: build validator (CSS token grep + spec count gate)
- ⏳ Stage 4: review hard-blocks (route inventory + env preflight + lens artifacts)
- ⏳ Stage 5: `/vg:test` codegen from TEST-GOALS + CRUD-SURFACES + route inventory
- ⏳ Stage 6: Codex adapter telemetry parity (closes #169)

Closes part of #173.

## v3.0.1 — Harness-readonly protection (2026-05-11)

### Bug
User flagged: "tôi vẫn thấy codex sửa được file của VGFlow mà không bị chặn". Confirmed via inspection of `vg-pre-tool-use-write.sh`:

| Layer | Protected | Not protected |
|---|---|---|
| `evidence_patterns` | `.vg/events.db`, `.vg/runs/*/evidence-*.json`, step markers | — |
| Harness source | — | `.claude/commands/vg/`, `.claude/skills/vg-*`, `.claude/scripts/`, `.codex/skills/`, `~/.vgflow/` |

Plus Codex has no PreToolUse hooks at all — completely bypasses Claude-side gates.

Result: AI agents (Claude AND Codex) could freely edit VGFlow harness files in dependent projects, corrupting installations.

### Fix — two layers

**Layer 1 — Claude PreToolUse Write/Edit hook:**
`scripts/hooks/vg-pre-tool-use-write.sh` extended with `harness_patterns` array covering:
- `.claude/commands/vg/.*`
- `.claude/skills/vg-[^/]+/.*`
- `.claude/scripts/.*`
- `.claude/schemas/.*\.json$`
- `.claude/templates/vg/.*`
- `.codex/skills/.*`
- `.codex/agents/.*\.toml$`
- `~/.vgflow/{commands,skills,scripts,schemas,templates,codex-skills,bin}/...`

Allow logic:
- vgflow source repo (cwd has `package.json` with `"name": "vgflow"`) → allowed (editing harness IS the workflow there)
- `VG_HARNESS_DEV=1` env → allowed (CI / dev override per-invocation)
- Else → BLOCK with diagnostic suggesting `/vg:update` or fork workflow

**Layer 2 — Per-project git pre-commit hook (catches Codex):**
`scripts/hooks/install-pre-commit-harness-guard.sh` installs a `.git/hooks/pre-commit` that rejects commits touching harness files. Same allow logic as Layer 1. Catches:
- Codex (no PreToolUse hooks)
- Any tool / human bypassing Claude PreToolUse
- Cross-runtime edits via shared filesystem

Install in any dependent project: `bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/hooks/install-pre-commit-harness-guard.sh`. Refuses to install in vgflow source repo (defensive).

### Test coverage
18 new tests in `tests/test_v3_0_1_harness_protection.py`:
- 9× content checks (run all platforms): patterns present, vgflow detection probe, VG_HARNESS_DEV override flag, mirror byte-identity for both files
- 9× functional smoke (Linux-only): hook blocks/allows correctly per scenario; pre-commit installer rejects harness commits in dependent project, skips vgflow source repo

Smoke verified Git Bash:
- T1 foreign project harness write → rc=2 (blocked) ✓
- T2 regular file write → rc=0 (allowed) ✓
- T3 vgflow-repo harness edit → rc=0 (allowed) ✓
- T4 VG_HARNESS_DEV=1 override → rc=0 (allowed) ✓
- T5 ~/.vgflow path → rc=2 (blocked) ✓
- Pre-commit installer T1 (foreign project): commit rejected ✓
- Pre-commit installer T2 (override): commit allowed ✓
- Pre-commit installer T3 (regular file): commit allowed ✓
- Pre-commit installer T4 (vgflow source): install skipped ✓

### Migration

**For users on v3.0.0** dependent project (any project where you ran `vg install`):

```bash
# Layer 1 (Claude hook) auto-active on next /vg:update — no action needed.

# Layer 2 (pre-commit, catches Codex):
bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/hooks/install-pre-commit-harness-guard.sh

# Override per-commit when needed (CI / approved harness fork):
VG_HARNESS_DEV=1 git commit -m "..."
```

### Known limitations

- Layer 1 only fires on Claude `Write`/`Edit` tools. Bash-driven writes (`echo > file`) bypass — but these are detected by `vg-pre-tool-use-bash.sh` separately.
- Layer 2 catches commits, not pre-commit unstaged edits. AI tools that stash edits without committing slip through. v3.1.x will add a session-end-hook to detect uncommitted harness drift.

### Roadmap
- v3.0.x — bug fixes
- v3.1.x — Stage 7 final consumer migrations + self-repair stale-hook detector + multi-version pinning + uncommitted-harness-drift session-end check
- v4.0.0 — drop legacy `__file__`-walk fallback

---

## v3.0.0 — Major / breaking (2026-05-11)

### Headline
**Global install at `~/.vgflow/`. Project state at `.vg/`. Marker-driven dual-mode resolver lets v2.x coexist with v3 layout transparently.**

### Why upgrade
- Single source of truth for VG harness on every machine instead of N project-local copies
- `/vg:update` works correctly across mode switches without leaving stale files
- Project repos shrink: `commands/`, `skills/`, `scripts/`, `schemas/`, `templates/vg/` move out of `.claude/` (still works for project-local opt-out)
- `npm install -g vgflow` first-class distribution
- Migration: one command (`vg-migrate-v3.sh`) — auto-merges per-phase deploy state, backs up everything

### Layout

| What | v2.x | v3.0.0 (default) |
|---|---|---|
| Harness assets (commands/skills/scripts/schemas) | `${project}/.claude/` | `~/.vgflow/` (global) |
| Hooks | `${project}/.claude/settings.json` (per-project) | `~/.claude/settings.json` (global) |
| Project state (events.db, runs/, phases/, bootstrap/) | `${project}/.vg/` | `${project}/.vg/` (unchanged) |
| Root docs (ROADMAP.md, FOUNDATION.md, vg.config.md) | `${project}/` | `${project}/.vg/{ROADMAP,FOUNDATION,config}.md` |
| Deploy state | `${project}/.vg/phases/{N}/DEPLOY-STATE.json` (per-phase) | `${project}/.vg/deploy/STATE.json` (project-level) |
| Install marker | none | `${project}/.vg/.install-target` ∈ `{global,project}` |

### Install (new)

```bash
# Recommended — npm public package
npm install -g vgflow
cd /path/to/your-project
vg install --global

# Or — one-line installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vietdev99/vgflow/main/install.sh | bash
cd /path/to/your-project
vg install --global
```

`vg install --global` writes `${cwd}/.vg/.install-target=global` so subsequent VG commands resolve `VG_HOME=~/.vgflow/` automatically. Uninstall via `vg uninstall --global`.

### Migrate from v2.x

```bash
# Inspect plan first
bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=global --dry-run

# Apply (interactive confirm)
bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=global

# Apply + auto-commit
bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=global --yes --commit
```

7-step pipeline:
1. Pre-flight (refuse if dirty working tree)
2. Backup `.claude/{commands,skills,scripts}` + `settings.json` → `.vg/.backup-<ts>/`
3. Move root docs → `.vg/`
4. **Auto-merge legacy per-phase `DEPLOY-STATE.json` → `.vg/deploy/STATE.json`** (preserves deploy history)
5. Apply target via `vg-cli-dispatcher.sh install --<target>`
6. Append `.vg/` whitelist to `.gitignore`
7. `vg doctor` smoke + stage all changes

Recovery (if needed): `cp -r .vg/.backup-<ts>/* .` + `git checkout`.

### Backwards compatibility

- **Project mode opt-out preserved.** Pass `vg install --project` (or `vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=project`) to keep legacy per-project layout. Marker = `project`. Hooks at `${project}/.claude/settings.json` referencing `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/...`.
- **Resolver dual-mode.** `find_repo_root()` walks cwd first, falls back to `__file__` (legacy). `find_vg_home()` reads marker, falls back to `~/.vgflow/` then `.claude/`. Existing scripts work unchanged.
- **Config loader dual-mode.** `commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md` probes `.vg/config.md` first, falls back to `.claude/vg.config.md`. Every skill loading config benefits transparently.
- **Doc resolver.** `resolve_vg_doc("ROADMAP.md")` returns `.vg/ROADMAP.md` when present, falls back to root.

### Stage map (v2.76.0 → v3.0.0)

| Stage | Version | Component |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | v2.76.0 | Resolver dual-mode (`find_repo_root` + `find_vg_home` + `vg_resolve_project_root`) |
| 2 | v2.77.0 | `resolve_vg_doc()` helper + `generate-gitignore-v3.py` |
| 3.1 | v2.78.0 | `install-hooks.sh --mode global\|project` |
| 4 | v2.80.0 | `vg` CLI install/uninstall/sync wire-up |
| 5 | v2.81.0 | `/vg:install` skill (first-run / re-install / switch / repair) |
| 6 | v2.82.0–v2.82.1 | Deploy decouple foundation (`schemas/deploy-state.v1.json` + `state.py` + `history.py` + `lock.py` + `phase_context.py`) |
| 7 critical | v2.84.0 | Config-loader dual-mode read |
| 7 followups | v2.84.2, v2.85.0 | `review_batch.py` dual-mode + `merge-deploy-states.py` |
| 7 chained | v2.87.0 | `vg-migrate-v3.sh` auto-merges deploy state at step 2.5 |
| 8 | v2.83.0 | `vg-migrate-v3.sh` migration script |
| 9 | v2.88.0 | Marker-aware `/vg:update` (closes 5 audit gaps) |
| 9 ship | v3.0.0 (this) | VERSION bump + README + GitHub release |

### Bonus — cognitive scaffolding (v2.86.0)

Inspired by audit of [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) (38k stars), 4 new docs:

- `commands/vg/LIFECYCLE.md` — 8-phase taxonomy (Init / Define / Scope / Plan / Build / Verify / Test / Accept + optional Deploy) with contract table per phase
- `commands/vg/_shared/discovery-flowchart.md` — visual Mermaid flowchart + alphabetical lookup mapping user intent → which `/vg:*`
- `commands/vg/_shared/eng-principles.md` — Hyrum's Law / Beyonce Rule / Shift Left / Test Pyramid / Trunk-Based / Fail-Closed / Provenance Binding / Idempotency, each mapped to VG gate locations
- `commands/vg/_shared/rationalization-tables.md` — 6 categories × ~26 rows of Excuse vs Reality, augmenting runtime `rationalization-guard.md`

### PR #172 bundled — TEST_PENDING gate

Splits review verdict types so lifecycle evidence gaps that belong to `/vg:test` route via `TEST_PENDING` instead of generic `BLOCK`. `/vg:next` routes `TEST_PENDING` reviews to `/vg:test` directly. `verify-matrix-evidence-link.py` now accepts both verdicts. New regression tests in `scripts/tests/test_runtime_map_crud_depth.py` + `scripts/tests/test_matrix_evidence_link_test_pending.py`.

### Test coverage cumulative

~150+ new tests across the v2.76 → v3.0.0 stages. Highlights:
- Resolver dual-mode (17 tests)
- Helpers + gitignore generator (14)
- Hook installer + vg CLI (13)
- /vg:install skill (13)
- Deploy decouple (29) + flock + phase context (17)
- Migration script (6) + chain merge-deploy-states (7) + merge-deploy-states helper (9)
- Config-loader dual-mode (10) + review_batch dual-mode (3)
- Tier 1 docs (26)
- Marker-aware /vg:update (12)

CI Test on Linux: full suite green from v2.84.1 onward (one regression in v2.84.0 fixed at v2.84.1).

### Migration checklist for users on v2.x

1. **Backup current project:** `git status` clean? Commit pending changes first.
2. **Install vgflow globally:** `npm install -g vgflow` (or `curl … | bash`).
3. **Inspect dry-run:** `bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=global --dry-run`. Review what would change.
4. **Apply migration:** `bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=global --yes --commit`.
5. **Restart Claude Code / Codex session.** Hooks and skill paths re-resolve.
6. **Verify:** `vg doctor`. Should show `marker: global`, `VG_HOME: ~/.vgflow/`, hook count > 0.
7. **First update post-migration:** `/vg:update` now refreshes `~/.vgflow/` via `git pull --ff-only origin main` (or `npm install -g vgflow@latest`), re-installs hooks with `--mode global`, cleans any stale project-local stragglers.

### What if migration goes wrong

- `git checkout main` discards working-tree changes (migration leaves changes staged unless `--commit` passed)
- `cp -r .vg/.backup-<ts>/* .` restores pre-migration state
- `git revert <migration-commit-sha>` if `--commit` was passed
- `npm install -g vgflow@2.43.1` (or older) downgrades global harness if needed

### Known limitations / deferred work

- **Stage 7 final consumer migrations** (`commands/vg/deploy.md` + build pre-test gate runtime updates) — deferred. Dual-mode helpers (`resolve_vg_doc`, `find_repo_root`, marker-aware update) bridge layouts transparently, so deferred work is not blocking. Will land in v3.1.x.
- **Self-repair stale-hook detector** — only partial. Cleanup covers most cases via `/vg:update` global path, but no proactive detector at session start. Will land in v3.1.x.
- **Multi-version global install** — single-version only in v3.0.0. Multi-version pinning (`~/.vgflow/versions/`) will land in v3.1.x.

### Roadmap forward

- **v3.0.x** — bug fixes, doc polish
- **v3.1.x** — Stage 7 consumer migrations + self-repair detector + multi-version pinning
- **v4.0.0** — drop legacy `__file__`-walk fallback, drop `.claude/vg.config.md` legacy reads (forced migration)

## v2.88.0 — marker-aware /vg:update (closes 5 v3.0.0 audit gaps) (2026-05-10)

### Bug
[caveman:cavecrew-investigator audit](https://github.com/vietdev99/vgflow) of `/vg:update` flow against v3.0.0 global-install contract identified 5 critical gaps:

| # | Question | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Does /vg:update read `.vg/.install-target`? | NO — zero marker awareness |
| 2 | Does it update `~/.vgflow/` when marker=global? | NO — only merges into `.claude/` |
| 3 | Does it clean stale `.claude/{commands/vg, skills/vg-*}` post-mode-switch? | NO |
| 4 | Does it rewrite hook entries after mode switch? | NO — install-hooks called without `--mode` |
| 5 | Does it self-repair stale hook paths? | NO |

User flagged via [PrintwayV3 dogfood](https://github.com/vietdev99/vgflow): "ở các lần update mới tới, các máy khác khi update thì có cập nhật global, dọn dẹp lại hook ở config, dọn dẹp lại các skill nằm trong các project không". Codex audit confirmed all 5 gaps would leave corrupted state on machines that switched install target via `/vg:install --target=switch`.

### Fix

**`commands/vg/_shared/update/preflight.md`** — adds 2 changes:

1. **Read marker** at step `0_preflight`: `INSTALL_TARGET=$(tr -d '[:space:]' < ${REPO_ROOT}/.vg/.install-target)`. Echoes for visibility.
2. **NEW step `0b_marker_branch`**: when `INSTALL_TARGET=global`, runs the global update path:
   - Try `git pull --ff-only origin main` in `~/.vgflow/.git/` (dev clone)
   - Fallback `npm install -g vgflow@latest`
   - Re-install hooks at `~/.claude/settings.json` with `--mode global`
   - Clean stale project-local `.claude/{commands/vg, scripts, schemas, templates/vg}` + `.claude/skills/vg-*` (backup to `.vg/.backup-<ts>-stale-cleanup/` first)
   - Bump `.vg/.global-vgflow-version` tracker
   - Exit 0 (skip legacy 3-way merge)

When marker is `project` or absent, falls through to legacy v2.x project-local 3-way-merge flow unchanged.

**`commands/vg/_shared/update/rotate-and-repair.md`** — install-hooks call now passes `--mode "$HOOK_MODE"` where `HOOK_MODE` reads marker (default `project`). Previously hardcoded `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/...` paths even when marker=global, leaving inconsistent settings.json.

### Test coverage
12 new tests in `tests/test_v2_88_marker_aware_update.py`, all PASS:
- `test_preflight_reads_install_target_marker`
- `test_preflight_skips_helper_check_when_global` (vg_update.py only required for project-mode merge)
- `test_preflight_has_marker_branch_step`
- `test_marker_branch_does_git_pull_when_clone` / `test_marker_branch_falls_back_to_npm`
- `test_marker_branch_reinstalls_hooks_with_mode_global`
- `test_marker_branch_cleans_stale_project_local_dirs` / `test_marker_branch_backs_up_before_cleanup`
- `test_marker_branch_exits_after_global_path` (critical — must short-circuit so legacy merge doesn't run on top)
- `test_rotate_and_repair_passes_mode_to_install_hooks`
- 2× mirror byte-identity

Bash syntax verified via file-mode `bash -n` check; codex equivalence: 59 pairs OK.

### Migration
None. Existing project-mode users see zero behavior change. Existing global-mode users (those who ran `/vg:install --target=global` previously) now get correct global-aware behavior on next `/vg:update`.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0–v2.87.0 — Stages 1-7 partial (resolver, helpers, hook installer, vg CLI, install skill, deploy decouple, migration helpers, vg-migrate chains deploy merge)
- v2.88.0 (this) — marker-aware /vg:update (closes audit gaps)
- **v3.0.0** — Stage 9: VERSION 3.0.0 + README rewrite + npm publish

## v2.87.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 7 chained: vg-migrate-v3 auto-merges deploy state (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Wire `merge-deploy-states.py` (v2.85.0) into `vg-migrate-v3.sh` (v2.83.0) at step 2.5. Post-migration projects now automatically have `.vg/deploy/STATE.json` populated from legacy per-phase data, no manual step required.

### Changes

**`scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh` updated**
- Adds new step 2.5 between "move root docs" (step 2) and "apply target" (step 3).
- Probes 3 locations for `merge-deploy-states.py`: project `.claude/scripts/migrate/`, `~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/`, `${VG_HOME}/scripts/migrate/`.
- Calls helper with `--backup` flag (preserves prior STATE.json if any).
- rc=0 → "deploy state merged"; rc=2 → "no per-phase state — nothing to merge" (legitimate no-op); other rc → warn but continue (deploy state isn't blocking for rest of migration).

### Test coverage
7 new tests in `tests/test_v2_87_migrate_chains_deploy_merge.py`:
- 5× content-only (run all platforms): step 2.5 block present, rc=2 no-op handling, 3 probe locations, --backup flag, mirror byte-identity
- 2× functional (Linux-only): full migration writes `.vg/deploy/STATE.json` from per-phase data + handles "no per-phase state" gracefully

Manual smoke verified on Git Bash:
- 2 phases with deploy state → `STATE.json` has both envs (`prod`, `staging`), `preferred_env_for_phase[5]=prod` carried over.

### Migration
None for end-users. Existing `vg-migrate-v3.sh` users automatically benefit on next migration run.

### Stage 7 Status
- ✓ config-loader.md (v2.84.0) — biggest fanout
- ✓ review_batch.py (v2.84.2)
- ✓ merge-deploy-states.py migration helper (v2.85.0)
- ✓ vg-migrate-v3.sh chains deploy merge (this v2.87.0)
- Deferred: deploy.md / pre-test-gate / enrich-env-question.py runtime updates — these can ship post-v3.0.0 since dual-mode helpers transparently bridge layouts

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0–v2.86.0 — Stages 1-6 + Tier 1 audit + Stage 7 partial
- v2.87.0 (this) — Stage 7 final wiring (auto-deploy-merge in migrate)
- **v3.0.0** — Stage 9: VERSION 3.0.0 + README rewrite + npm publish

## v2.86.0 — Tier 1 from agent-skills audit: lifecycle taxonomy + anti-rationalization tables + eng-principles + discovery flowchart (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Synthesize lessons from [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills) (38k stars) into VG. Content-only docs — zero runtime change. High-leverage cognitive scaffolding.

### Changes — 4 new docs

**`commands/vg/_shared/rationalization-tables.md` NEW (~150 lines, 6 categories, 26 rows)**

Static catalogue of common AI rationalizations encountered in VG pipeline runs, with concrete rebuttals. Augments runtime `rationalization-guard.md` (which spawns Haiku adjudicator for novel cases) by capturing recurring patterns up front.

Categories: Test/verification skips · Gate/contract skips · Code change skips · Migration/breaking change skips · Deploy/production skips · Documentation skips. Each row is `Excuse | Reality`.

**`commands/vg/_shared/eng-principles.md` NEW (~150 lines, 8 principles)**

Cross-cut reference for engineering principles VG gates encode. Skills cite this doc instead of re-deriving rationale. Principles: Hyrum's Law, Beyonce Rule, Shift Left, Test Pyramid, Trunk-Based Development, Fail-Closed by Default, Provenance Binding, Idempotency. Each section maps the principle → VG gate locations + AI implication.

**`commands/vg/_shared/discovery-flowchart.md` NEW (~120 lines + Mermaid)**

Visual decision tree mapping user intent → which `/vg:*` command. Top-level Mermaid `flowchart TD` for the 7-phase pipeline. Plus alphabetical "user says X → run Y" lookup table covering 25+ commands. Plus by-lifecycle-phase index. Plus adversarial detection ("when user says skip X").

**`commands/vg/LIFECYCLE.md` NEW (~150 lines + Mermaid)**

VG pipeline taxonomy as single-page mental model. 8-phase Mermaid `flowchart LR` (Init / Define / Scope / Plan / Build / Verify / Test / Accept + optional Deploy). Phase contract table: command + required artifact + downstream gates. Sub-phase tables for Scope's 5 rounds + Plan's 4 sub-steps + Verify's fix loop. Cycle vs sequential semantics documented.

### Cross-references between docs
All 4 docs cross-link via "Cross-references" footer sections. Loop: rationalization-tables → eng-principles → discovery-flowchart → LIFECYCLE → back. Plus runtime guard (`rationalization-guard.md`) referenced from static tables.

### Test coverage
26 new tests in `tests/test_v2_86_tier1_docs.py`, all PASS:
- 4× existence
- 4× mirror byte-identity (canonical ↔ `.claude`)
- 8× frontmatter / name / description
- rationalization-tables: 6 categories, Excuse/Reality columns, runtime-guard cross-ref
- eng-principles: 8 core concepts, 4 cross-refs
- discovery-flowchart: Mermaid block, 9 main commands listed
- LIFECYCLE: 8 phases, contract columns, 6 scope sub-phases

### Source attribution
Inspired by analysis of [addyosmani/agent-skills](https://github.com/addyosmani/agent-skills):
- Anti-rationalization tables → adopted (their pattern, VG-specific content)
- Lifecycle taxonomy → adopted (their 7-phase mental model → our 8-phase VG-specific contract)
- SRE references baked into skills → adopted (Hyrum's Law et al)
- Discovery flowchart pattern → adopted (Mermaid `flowchart` from their meta-skill)

### Migration
None. Pure content additions. Skills can begin citing new docs incrementally; no required updates.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0–v2.85.0 — Stages 1-7 partial (resolver, helpers, hook installer, vg CLI, install skill, deploy decouple, migration helpers)
- v2.86.0 (this) — Tier 1 cognitive scaffolding from agent-skills audit
- v2.87.x — Stage 7 final consumer migrations (deploy.md, build pre-test gate runtime updates)
- **v3.0.0** — Stage 9: VERSION 3.0.0 + README rewrite + npm publish

---

## v2.85.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 7.1: deploy state migration helper (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Stage 7.1 of v3.0.0 plan. Adds the helper that consolidates legacy per-phase `${PHASE_DIR}/DEPLOY-STATE.json` files into the v3 project-level `.vg/deploy/STATE.json` (schema shipped v2.82.0). Designed to be invoked by `vg-migrate-v3.sh` post Stage 8.

### Changes

**`scripts/migrate/merge-deploy-states.py` NEW**

Walks `.vg/phases/*/DEPLOY-STATE.json`, merges each env's latest entry (by `deployed_at`) into project STATE.json. Per-phase `preferred_env_for` field maps to project-level `preferred_env_for_phase[<phase>]`. Annotates `phase_context` automatically when the legacy entry didn't track it.

**Flags:**
- `--project-root <path>` (default cwd)
- `--dry-run` — print merged JSON to stdout, do NOT write STATE.json
- `--backup` — copy existing STATE.json to `.bak.<epoch>` before overwrite

**Exit codes:**
- 0 ok (state written / dry-run printed)
- 1 import error (cannot find `deploy.state` module)
- 2 no per-phase state files found (not an error — caller may skip)
- 3 write failed

Path resolution probes: `.claude/scripts/`, `scripts/`, `~/.vgflow/scripts/`, then script's own `scripts/migrate/.. = scripts/` parent — works whether invoked from a project clone, npm-installed VG_HOME, or directly from the migration helper directory.

### Test coverage
9 new tests in `tests/test_merge_deploy_states.py`, all PASS:
- `test_no_phase_states_returns_2` (rc=2 when nothing to merge)
- `test_dry_run_merges_single_phase` / `test_dry_run_does_not_write_state_json`
- `test_latest_deploy_wins_across_phases` (newest deployed_at per env)
- `test_preferred_env_per_phase_carried_over` (per-phase → project-level map)
- `test_multiple_envs_merged`
- `test_skips_corrupt_phase_state` (warn + continue)
- `test_backup_flag_creates_bak`
- `test_phase_context_added_when_missing` (auto-annotation)

### Migration
None for end-users. `vg-migrate-v3.sh` (Stage 8, v2.83.0) will call this helper in a future minor — currently optional / manual. Run via:

```bash
python3 ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/merge-deploy-states.py --project-root . --backup
```

### Stage 7 Status
- ✓ config-loader.md (v2.84.0) — biggest fanout
- ✓ review_batch.py (v2.84.2)
- ✓ merge-deploy-states.py migration helper (this v2.85.0)
- Deferred: deploy.md / pre-test-gate / enrich-env-question.py runtime updates — these will read project-level STATE.json once `vg-migrate-v3.sh` chains in this helper

---

## v2.84.2 — Stage 7 follow-up: review_batch dual-mode (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Continue Stage 7 consumer migrations. Fix `scripts/review_batch.py::_resolve_phases_milestone()` — was hardcoding root `ROADMAP.md`, would break post-migration projects.

### Changes

**`scripts/review_batch.py`** — `_resolve_phases_milestone()` now probes `.vg/ROADMAP.md` first, falls back to root `ROADMAP.md`. Error message lists both paths when neither exists.

Files: `scripts/review_batch.py` + `.claude` mirror.

### Test coverage
3 new tests in `tests/test_review_batch_dual_mode.py`, all PASS:
- `test_prefers_new_layout` — `.vg/ROADMAP.md` wins over root
- `test_falls_back_to_legacy` — root works when `.vg/` absent
- `test_returns_empty_when_neither_exists` — empty + stderr both paths

### Stage 7 Status
- ✓ config-loader.md (v2.84.0) — biggest fanout
- ✓ review_batch.py (v2.84.2)
- Deferred: deploy state migration (~3 sites — deploy.md, build pre-test gate, enrich-env-question.py) — contract change requiring per-phase → project-level state merge; defer to dedicated v2.85.x

### Migration
None required — backwards-compatible probe order.

## v2.84.1 — hotfix: vg-migrate-v3 detects untracked files (2026-05-10)

### Bug
v2.83.0 Test CI failed at `tests/test_vg_migrate_v3.py::test_dirty_tree_refused` (rc=5 expected rc=2). Root cause: `vg-migrate-v3.sh` pre-flight only checked `git diff --quiet` and `git diff --cached --quiet` — both return clean when files are merely **untracked**. An untracked file under `.claude/` would silently move to `.vg/.backup-<ts>/` during step 1, leaving the user staring at a confusing "where did my file go?" diff.

### Fix
Pre-flight now uses `git status --porcelain` (covers modified + staged + untracked + renamed). Refuses fast with rc=2.

Files:
- `scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh` + `.claude` mirror

Smoke verified on Git Bash: untracked file in committed repo → rc=2 with "working tree dirty" message.

---

## v2.84.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 7 critical: config-loader dual-mode read (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Stage 7 critical-path piece: every skill loads config via `commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md`. Without dual-mode read, post `vg-migrate-v3.sh` projects break instantly because the file moved from `.claude/vg.config.md` to `.vg/config.md`. This unblocks v3.0.0 ship for the highest-fanout consumer.

### Changes

**`commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md` updated**
- BOM-strip section now probes `.vg/config.md` first, falls back to `.claude/vg.config.md`. Resolved path stored in `VG_CONFIG_PATH` for downstream parsers.
- All 13 model `awk` parsers (planner, contract_gen, test_goals, executor, debugger, scanner, test_codegen + graphify section) now reference `"${VG_CONFIG_PATH:-.claude/vg.config.md}"` — same value when legacy-only, new path when migrated.
- `meta_memory_mode` grep uses `${VG_CONFIG_PATH}`.
- `vg_config_get` / `vg_config_get_array` helpers refactored to call new `_vg_config_resolve()` shell function — same dual-mode probe, allows ad-hoc callers (skills referencing `${config.X.Y.Z}`) to work post-migration without re-running BOM-strip.
- Drift detection error messages reference `${VG_CONFIG_PATH}` instead of hardcoded legacy path.

### Test coverage
10 new tests in `tests/test_config_loader_dual_mode.py` (8 PASS all platforms, 2 skipped on Windows due to WSL bash path mapping fragility — CI Linux validates):
- structural: probe order, path var capture, error message, model parsers, vg_config_get resolver, drift message, mirror byte-identity
- functional smoke (Linux): new layout wins, legacy fallback works

Smoke verified on Git Bash (3/3): new wins → `.vg/config.md`; remove new → `.claude/vg.config.md` falls back; neither → empty.

### Migration
None required. Default `${VG_CONFIG_PATH:-.claude/vg.config.md}` preserves existing behavior for unmigrated projects (no `.vg/config.md` present). Post-migration projects automatically pick up new path.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0–v2.82.1 — Stages 1-6 (resolver / helpers / hook installer / vg CLI / install skill / deploy decouple)
- v2.83.0 — Stage 8 vg-migrate-v3.sh
- v2.84.0 (this) — Stage 7 critical: config-loader dual-mode (highest-fanout consumer)
- v2.84.x — Stage 7 remaining: ~9 lower-fanout consumers (deploy.md, scope env-preference, build pre-test gate, etc.)
- **v3.0.0** — Stage 9: VERSION 3.0.0 + README rewrite + npm publish

---

## v2.83.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 8: vg-migrate-v3.sh migration script (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Stage 8 of v3.0.0 plan. Adds the headline migration tool that converts existing v2.x projects to v3 layout in one atomic command. Stage 7 (consumer migrations across ~10 sites) deferred — not blocking v3.0.0 ship since v2.7x dual-mode resolver + helpers transparently handle both layouts.

### Changes

**`scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh` NEW (Task 8)**

7-step migration pipeline:

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 0 | Pre-flight: refuse if not git repo or working tree dirty |
| 1 | Backup `.claude/{commands,skills,scripts}` + `settings.json` → `.vg/.backup-<ts>/` |
| 2 | Move root docs → `.vg/`: `ROADMAP.md`, `FOUNDATION.md`, `vg.config.md` → `.vg/config.md`, `OVERRIDE-DEBT.md` (if present) |
| 3 | Apply target via `vg-cli-dispatcher.sh install --<target>` (global removes legacy `.claude/{commands/vg, skills/vg-*, scripts}`; project keeps mirror) |
| 4 | Append `.vg/` whitelist to `.gitignore` via `generate-gitignore-v3.py` (idempotent — skips if marker present) |
| 5 | Verify `.vg/.install-target` marker (writes directly if dispatcher write didn't land) |
| 6 | Smoke test via `vg doctor` (non-fatal) |
| 7 | Stage all changes (auto-commit when `--commit` passed) |

**Flags:**
- `--target=global|project` (required)
- `--dry-run` — print actions without mutating
- `--yes` / `-y` — skip interactive confirmation
- `--commit` — atomic commit of staged changes

**Exit codes:** 0 success, 1 bad args, 2 dirty tree, 3 backup failed, 4 doc move failed, 5 hook install failed, 6 smoke (warning only).

### Test coverage
6 new tests in `tests/test_vg_migrate_v3.py` (Linux-only — skipped on Windows due to WSL path mapping; CI Linux validates):
- requires `--target` arg
- rejects invalid target value
- `--dry-run` does NOT mutate filesystem
- dirty tree refused (exit 2)
- full migration to global moves docs + marker + backup + .gitignore
- idempotent when already at target (exit 0 with no-op message)

Manual smoke verified on Git Bash:
- T1 dry-run preserves ROADMAP.md, no marker written: PASS
- T2 full migration: docs moved to `.vg/`, marker=global, backup created, `.gitignore` whitelist appended: PASS

### Migration
**For users:** to migrate an existing v2.x project, run:

```bash
# Inspect plan first
bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=global --dry-run

# Apply (interactive confirm)
bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=global

# Apply + auto-commit
bash ~/.vgflow/scripts/migrate/vg-migrate-v3.sh --target=global --yes --commit
```

Refuses to run on a dirty working tree. Backs up everything to `.vg/.backup-<ts>/` before mutating — recovery is `cp -r .vg/.backup-<ts>/* .` + `git checkout`.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0–v2.82.1 — Stages 1-6 (resolver, helpers, hook installer, vg CLI, install skill, deploy decouple)
- v2.83.0 (this) — Stage 8 migration script
- v2.84.x — Stage 7 consumer migrations (deploy.md + scope env-preference + build pre-test gate + ~7 more readers)
- **v3.0.0** — Stage 9: VERSION 3.0.0, README rewrite, npm publish, GitHub release

---

## v2.82.1 — v3.0.0 Stage 6 finish: flock + phase auto-detect (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Complete Stage 6 with the two helpers deferred from v2.82.0: per-env deploy lock and phase context auto-detection. Stage 6 fully shipped — Stage 7 (consumer migrations) next.

### Changes

**`scripts/deploy/lock.py` NEW (Task 6.4)**

`deploy_lock(project_root, env, holder_meta=...)` context manager:
- Per-env lock file `.vg/deploy/.deploy.lock.<env>` (slashes/parent-traversal sanitized)
- POSIX: `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)`; Windows: `msvcrt.locking(LK_NBLCK)`
- Non-blocking acquire — raises `DeployLockHeld(env, holder)` when contended
- Holder metadata (pid, started_at, env, caller-supplied) written for stale-lock diagnostics
- Lock file removed on exit (always — even after exception)

**`scripts/deploy/phase_context.py` NEW (Task 6.5)**

`detect_phase_context(project_root, override=None)` returns phase number or None:
1. Explicit override (CLI flag) — short-circuits
2. Newest `.vg/active-runs/*.json` `phase` field
3. Git branch matching `phase-<N>`, `vg-<N>`, `vg/<N>`, or `p<N>`
4. Last `/vg:scope` row in `.vg/events.db` (sqlite std-lib query)
5. None — caller persists deploy without phase_context

All branches soft-fail; never raises. Audit-only — runtime gates MUST NOT branch on result.

### Test coverage
17 new tests across 2 files:
- `tests/test_deploy_lock.py` — 7 tests (4 PASS on all platforms; 3 skipped on Windows due to msvcrt strict read-lock semantics — POSIX flock allows shared reads, validated on CI Linux)
- `tests/test_deploy_phase_context.py` — 10 tests (override, active-runs newest-wins, branch patterns, events.db fallback)

### Migration
None. Helpers added, no consumer migrations yet.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0–v2.82.0 — Stages 1-6 partial
- v2.82.1 (this) — Stage 6 finish (lock + phase auto-detect)
- v2.83.x — Stage 7: deploy migration script + ~10 consumer migrations (`commands/vg/deploy.md`, scope env-preference, build pre-test gate, etc.)
- **v3.0.0** — Stages 8-9: full migration script + npm publish

---

## v2.82.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 6: deploy decouple foundation (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Stage 6 of v3.0.0 plan. Deploy state moves from per-phase `.vg/phases/{N}/DEPLOY-STATE.json` to project-level `.vg/deploy/STATE.json`. Phase context preserved as audit-only field on each env entry. Helpers shipped, no consumer migrations yet (Stage 7 next minor).

### Changes

**`schemas/deploy-state.v1.json` NEW (Task 6.1)**
JSON Schema (draft-07) for project-level deploy state. Required: `schema_version=1`, `envs{}`. Per-env required: `sha`, `deployed_at`. Optional: `phase_context`, `previous_sha`, `rollback_target`, `health` (passing/failing/unknown/warming), `deploy_duration_sec`, `deploy_commands[]`, `deployer`, `release_tag`. Top-level optional: `preferred_env_for_phase{}`, `active_environments[]`, `updated_at`.

**`scripts/deploy/state.py` NEW (Task 6.2)**
`DeployState` dataclass + reader/writer. Atomic write via `<path>.tmp` → `os.replace()`. `set_env(env, sha, deployed_at, ...)` auto-rolls `previous_sha` from prior entry when caller omits. `set_preferred_env_for_phase(phase, env)` validates env exists. Optional `save(backup=True)` keeps prior file as `.bak.<epoch>`.

**`scripts/deploy/history.py` NEW (Task 6.3)**
`append_event(project_root, payload)` writes one JSON object per line to `.vg/deploy/history.jsonl`. Auto-adds `ts` field when caller omits. Rotates at 10 MB → `history-{date}.jsonl`. `read_events(env=, event=, since=, limit=)` for filtered queries. `latest_successful_sha(env, before=)` for rollback target derivation.

**Deferred to v2.82.1:**
- Task 6.4: per-env `flock .vg/deploy/.deploy.lock` for concurrent-deploy guard
- Task 6.5: auto-detect phase context from `.vg/active-runs/*.json`

### Test coverage
29 new tests across 2 files, all PASS:
- `tests/test_deploy_state.py` — 16 tests (schema validation, load/save, set_env auto-roll, atomic write, backup)
- `tests/test_deploy_history.py` — 13 tests (append, rotate, filter, latest_successful_sha)

### Migration
None. Helpers shipped without consumers — Stage 7 (v2.83.x) migrates `commands/vg/deploy.md` + ~10 readers (scope env-preference, build pre-test gate, test deploy step, etc.) to use the new helpers. Existing per-phase `.vg/phases/{N}/DEPLOY-STATE.json` continues to work until v3.0.0 migration script consolidates.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0–v2.81.0 — Stages 1-5 (resolver / helpers / hook installer / vg CLI / install skill)
- v2.82.0 (this) — Stage 6 deploy decouple foundation
- v2.82.1 — Stage 6 finish (flock + auto-detect phase context)
- v2.83.x — Stage 7: deploy migration + ~10 consumer migrations
- **v3.0.0** — Stages 8-9: migration script + npm publish

---

## v2.81.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 5: /vg:install skill (interactive ASK + switch + repair) (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Stage 5 of v3.0.0 plan. Adds interactive `/vg:install` skill that handles first-run, re-install, switch, and repair flows uniformly. Routes through `bin/vg-cli-dispatcher.sh` (Stage 4) — single source of truth for hook installation.

### Changes

**`commands/vg/install.md` NEW (Tasks 5.1, 5.2, 5.3)**

Decision matrix:

| Marker | Legacy `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION` | `--target` | `--repair` | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| absent | absent | unset | 0 | First-run → AskUserQuestion (global vs project) |
| absent | present | unset | 0 | Default to `project` (preserve legacy) |
| present | * | unset | 0 | Re-install matching marker silently |
| * | * | `global` \| `project` | 0 | Switch to specified target |
| * | * | `switch` | 0 | Toggle current marker |
| * | * | * | 1 | Re-apply current target (repair) |

**Frontmatter:**
- allowed-tools: `AskUserQuestion`, `Bash`, `Read`, `Write`
- runtime_contract: `install.started` + `install.completed` telemetry
- mutates_repo: true

**Backup-on-switch:** when switching marker (e.g., `project → global`), snapshot `.claude/{commands,skills,scripts}` + `.claude/settings.json` to `.vg/.backup-<ts>/` before applying new target.

**Drift detection:** if dispatcher write didn't update `.vg/.install-target` (older dispatcher or non-git cwd), skill writes marker directly.

Files:
- `commands/vg/install.md` NEW + `.claude` mirror (byte-identical)
- `codex-skills/vg-install/SKILL.md` regenerated via `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh --force` (Codex adapter prefix added automatically) + `.codex` mirror

### Test coverage
13 new tests in `tests/test_vg_install_skill.py`, all PASS:
- structure (frontmatter, telemetry contract, allowed-tools)
- decision matrix tokens (first-run / re-install / switch / repair)
- argument flags (`--target=global|project|switch`, `--repair`)
- routing through `vg-cli-dispatcher.sh`
- marker drift fallback (`printf '%s\n' "$RESOLVED" > "$MARKER"`)
- backup pattern `.vg/.backup-<ts>/`
- 4× mirror byte-identity (Claude + Codex)

Codex equivalence verifier: 59 pairs OK (no drift).

### Migration
None. New skill — existing flows unaffected. Run `/vg:install` to opt into v3 marker-driven layout (writes `.vg/.install-target`); subsequent `find_vg_home()` resolves correctly per project.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0 — Stage 1 resolver dual-mode
- v2.77.0 — Stage 2 helpers
- v2.78.0 — Stage 3.1 hook installer dual-mode
- v2.79.0 — Symmetric VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX (PR #166)
- v2.79.1 — Issue triage batch (5 closed)
- v2.80.0 — Stage 4 vg CLI install/uninstall wire-up
- v2.81.0 (this) — Stage 5 /vg:install skill
- v2.82.x — Stage 6: deploy decouple `.vg/deploy/STATE.json`
- v2.83.x — Stage 7: deploy migration + consumer migrations
- **v3.0.0** — Stages 8-9: migration script `vg-migrate-v3.sh` + npm publish

---

## v2.80.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 4: vg CLI install/uninstall wire-up (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Stage 4 of v3.0.0 plan. CLI dispatcher install/uninstall paths now wire up to the new `--mode global|project` flag (added v2.78.0) and write the `.vg/.install-target` marker so `find_vg_home()` (added v2.76.0) resolves correctly per project.

### Changes

**`vg install --global` (Task 4.1)**
- Calls `install-hooks.sh --mode global` → emits `$HOME/.vgflow/scripts/hooks/<name>` paths in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Writes `${cwd}/.vg/.install-target=global` (only inside a `.git` repo or where marker already exists)

**`vg install --project` (Task 4.2)**
- Calls `install-hooks.sh --mode project` → emits `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/<name>` paths
- Writes `${cwd}/.vg/.install-target=project`

**`vg uninstall [--global|--project]` (Task 4.3 — was stub)**
- Backs up target `settings.json` to `settings.json.bak.<epoch>`
- Removes all hook entries whose command contains `vg-`
- Cleans empty `hooks` event arrays + the top-level `hooks` key when empty
- Project mode: removes `.vg/.install-target` marker
- Does NOT delete `VG_HOME` (`~/.vgflow/`) or project `.vg/` (pure hook removal)

**`vg sync` / `vg update` (Task 4.4)**
- When `VG_HOME` is a git clone: `git pull --ff-only origin main`
- Otherwise: invoke `npm install -g vgflow@latest` (was: error out)
- Final fallback: stderr hint to clone or install npm

### Test coverage
7 new tests in `tests/test_vg_cli_dispatcher.py` (Linux-only — skipped on Windows due to WSL path mapping; CI Linux validates):
- `test_install_global_writes_marker_and_global_paths`
- `test_install_project_writes_marker_and_project_paths`
- `test_uninstall_project_removes_hooks_and_marker`
- `test_uninstall_no_settings_is_noop`
- `test_install_marker_skipped_when_not_in_git_repo`
- `test_version_command`
- `test_help_command`

Manual smoke verified on Git Bash: install --global, install --project, uninstall --project all PASS, settings.json paths correct, marker writes correctly.

### Migration
None. Default `--global` install behavior unchanged from v2.78.0; only adds marker write + uninstall implementation.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0 — Stage 1 resolver dual-mode
- v2.77.0 — Stage 2 helpers (resolve_vg_doc, gitignore generator)
- v2.78.0 — Stage 3.1 hook installer dual-mode
- v2.79.0 — Symmetric VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX (PR #166)
- v2.79.1 — Issue triage batch (5 closed)
- v2.80.0 (this) — Stage 4 vg CLI install/uninstall wire-up
- v2.81.x — Stage 5: `/vg:install` skill (interactive ASK flow)
- v2.82.x — Stage 6-7: deploy decouple + consumer migrations
- **v3.0.0** — Stages 8-9: migration script + npm publish

## v2.79.1 — hotfix triage batch: 5 issues closed (2026-05-10)

### Closed issues
| # | Sig | Type | Sev | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #171 | 066661d5 | helper_error | medium | bug-reporter `trap RETURN` invalid in zsh — guarded with `[ -n "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]` |
| #170 | eeaff650 | ai_inconsistency | medium | run-complete printed `✓ PASS` even when `--outcome BLOCK` — now respects caller outcome and prints `⚠ contract PASS, outcome=BLOCK` separately |
| #168, #165 (dup) | 6f68995d, 539aa67f | helper_error | high | filter-steps returned 0 after slim/_shared splits — now concatenates `commands/vg/_shared/<cmd>/*.md` sub-files before parsing `<step>` tags |
| #167, #164 (dup) | 145256fc, 7664c993 | gate_loop, self_discovery | high, medium | ghost active-run with `run_row=null` blocked new runs — `cmd_run_start` now detects via `db.run_row_exists()` and auto-clears with `run.ghost_cleared` telemetry |

### Deferred
- **#169** (sig `2fabd531`, gate_loop, high) — Codex adapter missing parity events for vg-review (`phase3d_5_qa_checker`, `review.completed`, `recursive_probe`). Needs deeper investigation of Codex adapter contract; deferred to v2.80.x adapter audit.

### Files changed
- `commands/vg/_shared/lib/bug-reporter.sh` + `.claude` mirror
- `scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__.py` + `.claude` mirror (run-start ghost detect, run-complete outcome separation)
- `scripts/filter-steps.py` + `.claude` mirror (concat _shared sub-files)

### Test coverage
9 new tests in `tests/test_v2_79_1_issue_fixes.py`, all PASS:
- 2× bug-reporter trap guard + mirror
- 2× run-complete outcome handling + mirror
- 1× run-start ghost clear
- 4× filter-steps slim split coverage (incl. smoke tests for review/build with non-zero step counts)

Smoke verified: `filter-steps --command commands/vg/review.md --profile web-fullstack --output-count` returns **37** (was 0); `build` returns 22; `deploy` returns 5; `specs` returns 9; `scope-review` returns 8.

### Migration
None. All fixes backwards-compatible. Existing runs benefit immediately on next `/vg:update`.

## v2.79.0 — symmetric VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX env var (2026-05-10)

### Feature
**Tri-state `VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX`** — symmetric counterpart to `VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX` (added v2.75.1). Lets users opt the project `.codex/` mirror out of `/vg:update` deploy without manual cleanup after each release.

### Background
v2.75.1 added auto-refresh for `~/.codex/skills/` (global) to fix duplicate-flow bug when user previously ran `install.sh --global-codex`. But step `8_sync_codex` still **unconditionally** deployed to project `.codex/skills/`. Users who chose to keep vgflow in `~/.codex` global only had no way to stop `/vg:update` from re-creating `.codex/skills/vg-*` + `.codex/agents/vgflow-*.toml` every release → duplicate flow registration on the project side instead of the global side.

### Behavior
`commands/vg/_shared/update/sync-and-report.md` step `8_sync_codex` now uses tri-state `VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX` (default = `auto`):

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `1` (legacy/explicit) | Always deploy to project `.codex/` |
| `0` (explicit opt-out) | Skip project deploy; warn if stale `.codex/skills/vg-update` detected |
| unset / `auto` (NEW default) | Auto-deploy ONLY when `.codex/skills/vg-update` already exists (i.e., project previously installed vgflow locally) |

Detection probe: `[ -d "${REPO_ROOT}/.codex/skills/vg-update" ]`. Symmetric with `VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX`.

### Migration
Non-breaking. After upgrading to v2.79.0:
- Projects with existing `.codex/skills/vg-update` continue to refresh on `/vg:update` (auto-detect kicks in).
- Future `install.sh` runs still populate `.codex/skills/vg-update`, then auto-detect refreshes on subsequent updates.
- Users who keep vgflow only in `~/.codex` global can now permanently opt out:
  ```bash
  rm -rf .codex/skills/vg-* \
         .codex/skills/{api-contract,flow-codegen,flow-runner,flow-scan,flow-spec,sandbox-test,test-depth,test-gen,test-review,test-scan,write-test-spec} \
         .codex/agents/vgflow-*.toml
  /vg:update                              # auto-detect skip
  VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX=0 /vg:update    # explicit per-run opt-out
  ```

### Test coverage
11 new tests in `tests/test_v2_76_0_project_codex_autorefresh.py` (filename retained from PR for traceability):
- `test_sync_file_has_project_autodetect_block`
- `test_sync_file_has_project_tristate_decision`
- `test_sync_file_handles_project_auto_default`
- `test_sync_file_warns_on_project_explicit_optout_with_stale`
- `test_sync_file_message_for_project_auto_deploy`
- `test_sync_file_legacy_optin_still_supported`
- `test_sync_file_project_skip_auto_message`
- `test_global_codex_gate_unchanged` (regression guard for v2.75.1 global gate)
- `test_sync_file_mirror_byte_identity`
- `test_codex_slim_documents_project_tristate`
- `test_codex_slim_mirror_byte_identity`

All v2.73 + v2.75.1 sync-and-report tests still pass (regression-free).

### Credits

## v2.78.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 3.1: hook installer dual-mode (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Stage 3.1 of v3.0.0 plan. Hook installer can now emit `$HOME/.vgflow/...` paths for global v3 installs while preserving the legacy `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/...` default for project-local installs.

### Changes

**`install-hooks.sh --mode global|project` (Task 3.1)**

| `--mode` | Emitted path | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `project` (default) | `"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/<name>"` | Backwards compat — existing v2.x project-local installs |
| `global` (NEW) | `"$HOME/.vgflow/scripts/hooks/<name>"` | v3.0.0 single-version global install |

Invalid mode value rejected with stderr message + exit 1.

Files:
- `scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh` + `.claude` mirror
- `tests/test_install_hooks_mode.py` NEW (6 tests, Linux-only — skipped on Windows due to WSL path mapping fragility; CI Linux validates)

### Test coverage
6 new tests, all PASS on Linux:
- `test_default_mode_emits_claude_project_dir`
- `test_project_mode_explicit_matches_default`
- `test_global_mode_emits_home_vgflow`
- `test_invalid_mode_errors`
- `test_global_mode_all_events_use_home_path`
- `test_idempotent_re_install`

Verified via manual Git Bash smoke test (3/3 PASS).

### Migration
None. Default mode = `project` preserves existing behavior. v3.0.0 migration script (Stage 8) will pass `--mode global` when user opts into global install.

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0 — Stage 1 resolver dual-mode
- v2.77.0 — Stage 2 helpers (`resolve_vg_doc`, gitignore generator)
- v2.78.0 (this) — Stage 3.1 hook installer dual-mode
- v2.79.x — Stage 3.2 codex hooks dual-mode + Stage 4 npm wire-up
- v2.7x.x — Stage 5-7: `/vg:install` skill + deploy decouple
- **v3.0.0** — Stages 8-9 migration + npm publish

---

## v2.77.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 2 (helpers): resolve_vg_doc + gitignore generator (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Stage 2 helpers for v3.0.0 layout migration. Stage 2.3 (consumer migrations across ~50 scripts) deferred to v2.78.x — this release ships helpers only with zero behavior change.

### Changes

**`resolve_vg_doc()` dual-mode helper (Task 2.1)**
Resolves VG docs (ROADMAP.md, FOUNDATION.md, vg.config.md) across new v3 layout (`.vg/<name>.md`) vs legacy root layout. Callers can migrate to `resolve_vg_doc("ROADMAP.md")` without caring whether project has been migrated. Special case: `vg.config.md` → `.vg/config.md` (vg. prefix dropped inside .vg/).

Resolution priority:
1. New layout: `.vg/<name>.md`
2. Legacy: `<root>/<name>.md`
3. Default: new-layout path (for future writes)

Files: `scripts/vg-orchestrator/_doc_resolver.py` NEW + `.claude` mirror.

**`generate-gitignore-v3.py` whitelist generator (Task 2.2)**
Emits `.gitignore` patterns for v3 `.vg/` layout: blanket `.vg/*` ignore + whitelist for tracked files (ROADMAP, FOUNDATION, config, phases/**, bootstrap tracked, deploy STATE.json + history) + re-ignore for untracked subpaths (events.db, runs/, deploy-log.*, etc.). Idempotent.

Used by Stage 8 migration script + Stage 5 `/vg:install` skill to seed `.vg/` whitelist.

Files: `scripts/migrate/generate-gitignore-v3.py` NEW + `.claude` mirror.

### Test coverage
14 new tests across 2 files, all PASS:
- `tests/test_doc_resolver.py` — 6 tests
- `tests/test_gitignore_v3.py` — 8 tests

### Migration
None. Helpers added, no consumers updated. Existing project-local installs unchanged.

### Roadmap
- v2.77.0 (this) — Stage 2 helpers
- v2.78.x — Stage 2.3: ~50 consumer migrations to use `resolve_vg_doc()`
- v2.79.x — Stage 3: hook installer dual-mode
- v2.7x.x — Stages 4-7: npm wire-up, /vg:install skill, deploy decouple
- **v3.0.0** — Stages 8-9: migration script + npm publish

---

## v2.76.0 — v3.0.0 Stage 1: resolver dual-mode (2026-05-10)

### Goal
Foundation for v3.0.0 global install (`~/.vgflow/`). Stage 1 of [v3 implementation plan](docs/plans/2026-05-09-vg-global-install-implementation.md). Backwards compatible — existing project-local installs continue working unchanged.

### Why
v3.0.0 ships VG harness as global install. Scripts in `~/.vgflow/` cannot walk `__file__` to find the user's project `.git`. Solution: cwd-walk takes priority over `__file__`-walk; `__file__`-walk retained as legacy fallback.

### Changes

**`find_repo_root()` priority swap (Task 1.1)**
Resolution priority changed from (1, 3, 4) to (1, 2, 3, 4):
1. `VG_REPO_ROOT` env or `VG_PROJECT` alias (NEW v2.76.0+)
2. **Walk cwd → ancestor with `.git/` (NEW)**
3. Walk `__file__` anchor → ancestor with `.git/` (legacy fallback)
4. cwd with stderr warning (last resort)

Files: `scripts/vg-orchestrator/_repo_root.py` + `.claude` mirror.

**`find_vg_home()` helper NEW (Task 1.2)**
Distinct from `find_repo_root()`:
- `VG_HOME` → static assets (skills, commands, scripts, schemas)
- `VG_PROJECT` → project state (`.vg/`)

Resolution priority:
1. `VG_HOME` env
2. Project marker `.vg/.install-target` → `"global"|"project"`
3. Legacy `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION` → project mode
4. `~/.vgflow/` fallback if exists
5. `RuntimeError("VG not installed. Run: npm install -g vgflow")`

Files: `scripts/vg-orchestrator/_vg_home.py` NEW + `.claude` mirror.

**`vg_resolve_project_root()` shell helper (Task 1.3)**
Bash-side mirror of `find_repo_root()` for hooks. Resolves project root from cwd-walk + env, returns 1 with stderr message on failure.

Files: `scripts/hooks/_lib.sh` + `.claude` mirror (37 lines appended).

### Test coverage
17 new tests across 3 files:
- `tests/test_resolver_dual_mode.py` — 4 tests, all PASS
- `tests/test_find_vg_home.py` — 7 tests, all PASS
- `tests/test_resolve_project_root_shell.py` — 6 tests (Linux); skipped on Windows due to WSL path mapping; CI validates

Regression check: `tests/test_worktree_isolation.py` 4/4 PASS (no break).

### Migration
None. Backwards compatible. Existing project-local installs continue using `__file__`-walk fallback when cwd-walk doesn't find `.git/` (e.g., temp-dir hook spawns).

### Roadmap
- v2.76.0 (this) — Stage 1: resolver dual-mode
- v2.7x.x — Stage 2-7: layout migration helpers, hook installer dual-mode, npm install/update wire-up, `/vg:install` skill, deploy decouple, consumer migrations
- **v3.0.0** (major, breaking) — Stage 8-9: migration script `vg-migrate-v3.sh`, E2E + npm publish, full ~/.vgflow/ rollout

## v2.75.2 — hotfix: CI Test workflow green (2026-05-10)

### Bug fix
**Test CI workflow has been failing on `main` since v2.73.0** (5 consecutive releases). 11 tests fail because content extracted into `_shared/<cmd>/*.md` sub-files during v2.73.0 (deploy), v2.74.0 (scope-review), v2.75.0 (specs/debug) splits — but tests still scan only `commands/vg/<cmd>.md` slim parent. Plus 1 codex mirror byte-identity test failed because `.codex/skills/vg-learn/SKILL.md` had drifted 17 bytes from canonical.

### Fixes

**Codex mirror sync (`.codex/skills/`)**
Refreshed all 71 skill bodies under `.codex/skills/<X>/SKILL.md` from canonical `codex-skills/<X>/SKILL.md`. 16 skills had drift, including 818-line stale `vg-update` (now 242). This unblocks `test_learn_consolidate_mode::test_codex_skill_mirror_byte_identical` and prevents future false drift reports.

**Test helper `tests/conftest.py` (NEW)**
`read_command_full(cmd)` returns slim parent + all `_shared/<cmd>/*.md` sub-files concatenated. Use for content scans (regex/substring) that must find text regardless of slim split.

**Tests broadened to scan parent + `_shared/<cmd>/`:**
- `tests/test_post_wave_mandatory_block.py` — MANDATORY POST-WAVE CONTINUATION block now found in `_shared/deploy/execute.md`
- `tests/e2e/test_meta_memory_loop.py` — `meta_memory_mode` gate now found in `_shared/deploy/execute.md` + `_shared/deploy/persist-and-close.md`
- `tests/test_bug_d_universal_tasklist.py::test_specs_md_has_create_task_tracker_step` — `<step name="create_task_tracker">` now found in `_shared/specs/preflight.md`
- `tests/test_codex_inline_parallel.py` — `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`, MCP/browser inline note, Haiku warning now found in `_shared/review/*`
- `tests/test_deepscan_default_on.py` — `--skip-deepscan` flag, `CONFIG_REVIEW_DEEPSCAN_DEFAULT` now found in `_shared/review/*`. Also fixed `test_changelog_documents_breaking_change` regex (was matching `v2.65.0` substring inside other prose; now anchored to `^## v2.65.0` header).

### Test coverage
All 11 originally-failing CI tests now pass. Local Ubuntu-equivalent run: full pytest tree green for previously-failing tests.

### Migration
None. Test refactor only. No production behavior change.

## v2.75.1 — hotfix: auto-refresh global ~/.codex on /vg:update (2026-05-10)

### Bug fix
**Duplicate-flow bug.** `/vg:update` previously only refreshed project-local `.codex/skills/`. If user had run `install.sh --global-codex` before, `~/.codex/skills/` stayed stale. Codex CLI loads skills from BOTH locations → each flow registered TWICE = duplicate-flow registration.

### Behavior change
`commands/vg/_shared/update/sync-and-report.md` step `8_sync_codex` now uses tri-state `VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX` (default = `auto`):

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `1` (legacy opt-in) | Always refresh `~/.codex/skills/` |
| `0` (explicit opt-out) | Skip global refresh; warn if stale `~/.codex/skills/vg-update` detected |
| unset / `auto` (NEW default) | Auto-refresh global ONLY when `~/.codex/skills/vg-update` already exists (i.e., user previously installed vgflow globally) |

Detection probe: `[ -d "$HOME/.codex/skills/vg-update" ]`. If present, /vg:update assumes prior global install and refreshes to keep both layers in sync.

### Test coverage
8 new tests in `tests/test_v2_75_1_global_codex_autorefresh.py`:
- `test_sync_file_has_autodetect_block`
- `test_sync_file_has_tristate_decision`
- `test_sync_file_handles_auto_default`
- `test_sync_file_warns_on_explicit_optout_with_stale_global`
- `test_sync_file_message_for_auto_refresh`
- `test_sync_file_mirror_byte_identity`
- `test_codex_skill_routes_to_sync_subfile`
- `test_legacy_optin_still_supported`

### Migration
No migration. After upgrading to v2.75.1, the next `/vg:update` will auto-detect and refresh global vgflow if present. Manual cleanup for users who already have duplicate registration:

```bash
# Either rerun /vg:update (auto-refresh kicks in)
/vg:update

# Or force one-time refresh
VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX=1 /vg:update

# Or manually remove stale global vgflow skills:
rm -rf ~/.codex/skills/vg-* \
       ~/.codex/skills/{api-contract,flow-codegen,flow-runner,flow-scan,flow-spec,sandbox-test,test-depth,test-gen,test-review,test-scan,write-test-spec}
```

## v2.75.0 — specs + debug splits + codex sync (2026-05-10)

### Refactor
Continue codex-skills/claude-commands sync. specs + debug pairs now slim.

### Claude-side splits
- **commands/vg/specs.md: 589 → 183 lines** — extracted into NEW `_shared/specs/`:
  - `preflight.md` — create_task_tracker, parse_args, check_existing
  - `mode-and-draft.md` — choose_mode, guided_questions, generate_draft
  - `write-and-commit.md` — write_specs, write_interface_standards, commit_and_next
- **commands/vg/debug.md: 570 → 121 lines** — extracted into NEW `_shared/debug/`:
  - `preflight.md` — 0_parse_and_classify
  - `discovery-and-fix.md` — 1_discovery, 2_hypothesize_and_fix
  - `verify-and-close.md` — 3_verify_and_loop, 4_complete

### Codex slims
- **codex-skills/vg-specs/SKILL.md: 684 → 277 lines** — routes to v2.75.0 `_shared/specs/*`
- **codex-skills/vg-debug/SKILL.md: 690 → 236 lines** — routes to v2.75.0 `_shared/debug/*`

### Bug fix
- `scripts/tests/test_bypass_negative.py:145` — updated assertion to also accept new error text "Another session already owns phase 99" (cross-session conflict path); preserves backwards compat with same-session "Active run exists" path.

### Test coverage
**~50 new tests across 8 suites.** All pass.

### Migration
No migration. Operators continue calling `/vg:specs`, `/vg:debug` — entries route through slim files.

## v2.74.1 — Hotfix CI release codex equivalence (2026-05-10)

### Bug fix
- `scripts/verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py` updated to skip skills with `commands/vg/_shared/<name>/` subdir (split skills intentionally diverge for Codex hook parity — mirror byte-identity enforced separately via per-split test suites).
- Synced 3 pre-existing drifts that had been failing release CI for past 2 days:
  - **vg-lesson**: claude `target_step` enum extended to match codex (added test/accept/deploy/roam/amend)
  - **vg-learn**: relocated Codex-specific runtime note INSIDE `<codex_skill_adapter>` block so verifier strips it
  - **vg-reflector**: claude side updated with procedural/declarative types + conditions DSL + sequence/success_signals + fingerprint section (codex side was newer)

### Why CI was failing
v2.70.0+ split work added `_shared/<name>/` subdirs with slim routing on both claude AND codex sides. Codex slim added HARD-GATE-CODEX + per-route mark-step fallbacks (Codex has no PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks). The legacy P19 verifier (added in v2.13.0) compared sha256 of claude command body vs codex SKILL body — split skills intentionally diverge so the gate failed every release tag since v2.70.0. Plus 3 unrelated pre-existing drifts that should have been synced earlier.

## v2.74.0 — scope-review split + codex sync (2026-05-10)

### Refactor
Continue codex-skills/claude-commands sync after v2.73.0.

### Claude-side scope-review.md split
- **commands/vg/scope-review.md: 670 → 83 lines (~88% reduction)** — extracted into NEW `_shared/scope-review/`:
  - `preflight.md` (265 lines) — 0_parse_and_collect, incremental_check
  - `cross-ref-review-write.md` (216 lines) — 1_cross_reference, 2_crossai_review, 3_write_report
  - `resolve-and-close.md` (148 lines) — 4_resolution, 4.5_baseline_write_and_telemetry, 5_commit_and_next

### Codex slim
- **codex-skills/vg-scope-review/SKILL.md: 809 → 221 lines (~73% reduction)** — routes to NEW v2.74.0 `_shared/scope-review/*`

### Behavior
**Zero behavior change.** Verbatim extraction (CRLF preserved via Python). Mirror byte-identity verified.

### Test coverage
**25 new tests across 5 suites** (T1: 6 preflight split, T2: 6 cross-ref-review-write split, T3: 6 resolve-and-close split, T4: 3 ceiling, T5: 4 codex slim). All pass.

### Migration
No migration. Operators continue calling `/vg:scope-review` — entries route through slim files transparently.

## v2.73.0 — Deploy sync + update.md split (2026-05-10)

### Refactor
Closes last codex-skills sync drift after v2.72.0. deploy.md split + slim codex vg-deploy. update.md split + slim codex vg-update.

### Claude-side splits
- **commands/vg/deploy.md: 574 → 121 lines (79% reduction)** — extracted into `_shared/deploy/`:
  - `preflight.md` (238 lines) — 0_parse_and_validate, 0a_env_select_and_confirm
  - `execute.md` (144 lines) — 1_deploy_per_env
  - `persist-and-close.md` (83 lines) — 2_persist_summary, complete
  - (existing: overview.md, per-env-executor-contract.md)
- **commands/vg/update.md: 676 → 103 lines (85% reduction)** — NEW `_shared/update/` (5 sub-files):
  - `preflight.md` (43 lines) — 0_preflight, 1_check_only_mode
  - `version-and-changelog.md` (142 lines) — 2_version_compare, 3_changelog_preview, 4_breaking_gate
  - `fetch-and-merge.md` (195 lines) — 5_fetch_tarball, 6_three_way_merge_per_file, 6b_verify_gate_integrity
  - `rotate-and-repair.md` (64 lines) — 7_rotate_ancestor_and_version, 7b_repair_hooks
  - `sync-and-report.md` (199 lines) — 8_sync_codex, 8b_repair_playwright_mcp, 8c_ensure_graphify, 9_report

### Codex slims
- **codex-skills/vg-deploy/SKILL.md: 669 → 286 lines (57% reduction)** — routes to v2.73.0 `_shared/deploy/*`
- **codex-skills/vg-update/SKILL.md: 818 → ~300 lines (~63% reduction)** — routes to NEW v2.73.0 `_shared/update/*`

### Test infrastructure improvement
- `tests/skills/conftest.py` — `skill_loader` now auto-merges `_shared/<name>/*.md` into body (`text` field). `lines` field stays canonical-only so slim-size gates still enforce. Universal fix for all future splits.

### Behavior
**Zero behavior change.** Verbatim extraction. Markers, telemetry, bash logic preserved. Mirror byte-identity verified.

### Test coverage
**55 new tests across 12 suites** (T1-T4: 21 deploy split, T5: 4 codex deploy, T6-T10: 30 update split, T11: 3 update ceiling, T12: 4 codex update). All pass.

### Migration
No migration. Operators continue calling `/vg:deploy`, `/vg:update` — entries route through slim files transparently.

### Reduction summary across v2.70-v2.73
| Side | review | project | migrate | deploy | update | Total saved |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude before | 8159 | 1590 | 1301 | 574 | 676 | 12300 |
| Claude after | 539 | 222 | 79 | 121 | 103 | 1064 (-91%) |
| Codex before | 7757 | 1728 | 1440 | 669 | 818 | 12412 |
| Codex after | 488 | 363 | 224 | 286 | ~300 | 1661 (-87%) |

## v2.72.0 — Codex-skills sync + migrate.md split (2026-05-10)

### Refactor — eliminates codex-skills/claude-commands drift after v2.70.0/v2.71.0
**User-flagged critical issue:** Codex CLI handles review pipeline. After v2.70.0 split (review.md 8159→539), codex-skills/vg-review/SKILL.md remained 7757 lines monolithic — context-budget bug.

### Claude-side migrate.md split (T1-T4)
- `commands/vg/migrate.md`: **1301 → 79 lines (94% reduction)**
- 4 new sub-files in `_shared/migrate/`:
  - `preflight.md` (178 lines) — 1_parse_args, 2_detect_artifacts, 3_backup_originals
  - `enrich.md` (301 lines) — 4_enrich_context, 5_generate_contracts
  - `goals-plans.md` (356 lines) — 6_generate_goals, 6_5_link_plan_goals, 7_attribute_plans
  - `pipeline-and-validate.md` (403 lines) — 8_write_pipeline_state, 8b_backfill_infra, 9_validate_and_report

### Codex-skills slim (T6-T8) — context-budget fix
- **codex-skills/vg-review/SKILL.md: 7757 → 488 lines (94% reduction)** — routes to v2.70.0 `_shared/review/*` (9 sub-files). Critical for Codex review runtime.
- **codex-skills/vg-project/SKILL.md: 1728 → 363 lines (79% reduction)** — routes to v2.71.0 `_shared/project/*` (5 sub-files).
- **codex-skills/vg-migrate/SKILL.md: 1440 → 224 lines (84% reduction)** — routes to NEW v2.72.0 `_shared/migrate/*` (4 sub-files).

### Preserved across all codex slims
- Frontmatter (name/description/metadata)
- `<codex_skill_adapter>` envelope (runtime contract, tool mapping, spawn precedence, tier mapping, caveats)
- `<HARD-GATE-CODEX>` block (where present — v2.65.0 A9 manual mark-step list)
- `<LANGUAGE_POLICY>`, `<TASKLIST_POLICY>`, `<rules>`, `<objective>`, `<success_criteria>`
- v2.65.0 A9 manual `mark-step` calls per routing entry (Codex hook fallback)
- v2.67.0 #158 lens telemetry parity calls

### Behavior
**Zero behavior change.** Codex skills load `_shared/X/Y.md` files transparently via "Read X.md and follow it exactly." instruction (mirror `codex-skills/vg-build/SKILL.md` pattern from earlier). Markers, telemetry, bash logic preserved exactly.

### Test coverage
**42 new tests across 8 suites** (T1-T4: 25 split tests, T5: 3 ceiling, T6-T8: 14 slim coverage). All pass. Zero regression.

### Migration
No migration. Operators continue calling `/vg:migrate`, `/vg:review`, `/vg:project` — entries route through slim files transparently.

### Total reduction across v2.70.0+v2.71.0+v2.72.0
| Side | review | project | migrate | Total saved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude before | 8159 | 1590 | 1301 | 11050 |
| Claude after | 539 | 222 | 79 | 840 (-92%) |
| Codex before | 7757 | 1728 | 1440 | 10925 |
| Codex after | 488 | 363 | 224 | 1075 (-90%) |

## v2.71.0 — project.md full split (2026-05-10)

### Refactor
Extracted `commands/vg/project.md` (1590 lines monolithic) into `commands/vg/_shared/project/` subdir mirroring v2.70.0 review.md split + build.md slim entry pattern. **project.md slim to 222 lines (86% reduction).**

### Sub-files (5 new in `commands/vg/_shared/project/`)
- `preflight.md` (467 lines) — 3 gate/parse steps (0_parse_args, 0b_print_state_summary, 0c_scan_existing_docs)
- `routing.md` (182 lines) — 4 mode-routing steps (1_route_mode, 2a_resume_check, 2b_mode_menu, 3_mode_view)
- `first-time-rounds.md` (544 lines) — **largest** — 4_mode_first_time + 9 rounds (capture, parse, dialog, confirmation gate, constraints, auto-derive, architecture lock, security strategy, atomic write)
- `update-modes.md` (100 lines) — 3 update steps (5_mode_update, 6_mode_milestone, 7_mode_rewrite)
- `migrate-and-init.md` (100 lines) — 3 migrate/init/complete steps (8_mode_migrate, 9_mode_init_only, 10_complete)

### project.md slim entry
project.md retains frontmatter + HARD-GATE + STEP routing. Each STEP block replaced with: "Read `_shared/project/X.md` and follow it exactly."

### Behavior
**Zero behavior change.** Extracted content is verbatim. Markers, telemetry, bash logic preserved exactly. Mirror byte-identity verified for all canonical/.claude pairs.

### Test coverage
**33 new tests across 6 suites** (5 split tests × 6 each + 3 ceiling tests). All pass.

### Migration
No migration. Operators continue calling `/vg:project` — entry routes through slim project.md → extracted sub-files transparently.

## v2.70.0 — review.md full split (2026-05-10)

### Refactor
Extracted `commands/vg/review.md` (8159 lines monolithic) into `commands/vg/_shared/review/` subdir mirroring build.md slim entry + delegation files pattern. **review.md slim to 539 lines (93.4% reduction).**

### Sub-files (9 new in `commands/vg/_shared/review/`)
- `preflight.md` (851 lines) — 7 gate/parse/profile steps (00_gate_integrity, 00_session_lifecycle, 0_parse_and_validate, 0a_env_mode_gate, 0b_goal_coverage_gate, 0c_telemetry_suggestions, create_task_tracker)
- `phase-p-variants.md` (862 lines) — 6 phaseP variants (profile_branch, infra_smoke, delta, regression, schema_verify, link_check)
- `code-scan.md` (656 lines) — phase1_code_scan + phase1_5_ripple_and_god_node
- `api-and-discovery.md` (1161 lines) — phase2a_api_contract_probe + phase2_browser_discovery
- `lens-and-findings.md` (862 lines) — 8 phase2.5/2b/c/d/e/f steps (lens probe, findings derivation, auto-fix routing)
- `limits-and-mobile.md` (681 lines) — exploration limits + mobile discovery + visual checks
- `url-and-error.md` (321 lines) — phase2.7/2.8/2.9 URL state + error message runtime
- `fix-loop-and-goals.md` (1443 lines) — phase3_fix_loop + phase4_goal_comparison (largest combined section)
- `close.md` (823 lines) — unreachable_triage + crossai_review + write_artifacts + bootstrap_reflection + complete

### review.md slim entry
review.md retains frontmatter + LANGUAGE_POLICY + HARD-GATE + STEP routing. Each STEP block replaced with: "Read `_shared/review/X.md` and follow it exactly." Pattern matches `commands/vg/build.md` slim entry style.

### Behavior
**Zero behavior change.** Extracted content is verbatim. Step markers, telemetry events, bash logic preserved exactly. Mirror byte-identity verified for all canonical/.claude pairs.

### Test impact
**60 new tests across 10 suites** (54 split tests + 3 ceiling tests + 3 helper updates). Tests previously grep'ing review.md body content updated to use `review_text_full()` helper that concatenates review.md + `_shared/review/*.md`. All v2.65.0-v2.69.0 tests still pass. Zero regression.

### Migration
No migration. Operators continue calling `/vg:review {phase}` — entry routes through slim review.md → extracted sub-files transparently. No behavioral change.

## v2.69.0 — Flip B1+B4+C2 advisory gates to blocking (2026-05-10)

### Behavioral changes (3 gates flip warn→block) — BREAKING
- **B1 (v2.66.0):** `5_1_spec_compliance_review` per-task spec reviewer marker now `required_unless_flag: "--skip-spec-review"` (was `severity: warn`). Build BLOCKs when reviewer FAILs and flag absent.
- **B4 (v2.66.1):** `7_1_5_final_review` cumulative reviewer marker added to `commands/vg/build.md` `must_touch_markers` (was documented only) with `required_unless_flag: "--skip-final-review"`. Build BLOCKs when reviewer FAILs and flag absent.
- **C2 (v2.68.0):** `phase3d_5_qa_checker` QA-Checker meta-agent marker added to `commands/vg/review.md` `must_touch_markers` with `required_unless_flag: "--skip-qa-check"`. Review BLOCKs when QA-Checker FAILs and flag absent.

### Escape hatches (each pairs with --override-reason)
- **`--skip-spec-review`** (build): Skips B1 per-task spec compliance review. Logs override-debt entry via `log_override_debt`. Marker still touched to satisfy contract validator.
- **`--skip-final-review`** (build): Skips B4 cumulative review. Same debt-logging.
- **`--skip-qa-check`** (review): Skips C2 QA-Checker meta-verification. Same debt-logging.
- All 3 flags added to `forbidden_without_override:` list — must pair with `--override-reason=<text>` per debt-register protocol. `scripts/validators/override-debt-balance.py` enforces.

### Telemetry
Each gate now emits `{b1,b4,c2}.verdict` event after verdict computation with metadata `{phase, verdict, confidence}`. Operators query events.db for PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL distribution + escape-hatch usage rate. Future tuning data-driven.

### Test coverage
**18 new tests across 4 suites.** All pass. Zero regression on v2.65.0-v2.68.0 (all prior B1/B4/C2 tests still pass).

### Migration
- **BREAKING:** Phases that hit B1/B4/C2 FAIL verdicts will now block instead of advise. To preserve v2.68.x behavior temporarily: pass appropriate `--skip-{gate}` flag + `--override-reason=<text>`. Example: `/vg:build 7.1 --skip-final-review --override-reason="legacy phase, B4 retroactive validation impractical"`.
- Default escape-hatch usage tracks via override-debt events — operators see exactly which gates are routinely skipped (signal for actual fix vs systemic exemption).
- Verdict telemetry events feed future v2.70.x tuning (severity-bucket adjustments, false-positive thresholds).

## v2.68.0 — C-tier strict review research adoptions (2026-05-10)

### Features (research-driven hardening — 6 patterns adopted)
- **C1 Evidence Gate (obra/superpowers):** Retrofitted 3 missing validators (`runtime-evidence.py`, `verify-workflow-evidence.py`, `verify-read-evidence.py`) to write structured `${PHASE_DIR}/.evidence/<gate_id>.json` with verdict/findings/signed_at fields. Audit trail now complete across all L-gate validators.
- **C2 QA-Checker meta-agent (CodeAgent paper):** New `.claude/agents/vg-review-qa-checker/SKILL.md`. Verifies fix commits actually address original issue claims (not just tests pass). Detects suppression hacks (`@ts-ignore`, `noqa` without justification), false fixes (commit doesn't touch finding files), test reverts. Verdict: PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL. Wired in review Phase 3d.5 (after fix-loop converges). Severity=warn in v2.68.0 (advisory), will flip to block in v2.69.0.
- **C3 Hybrid gate:** Hybridized `runtime-evidence.py` with deterministic-then-LLM-fallback pattern. New verdicts: PASS (high confidence), AMBIGUOUS (defer to LLM judgment), FAIL. Confidence score (high/medium/low) emitted alongside verdict. Hard-block signals (playwright_failed, missing_last_run_json, etc.) preserved deterministic — only soft signals get hybrid downgrade.
- **C4 Discourse phase (open-code-review):** Replaced voting-based aggregator at `crossai-normalize-results.py:188-210` with `compute_discourse_verdict()` that emits AGREE/CHALLENGE/CONNECT/SURFACE moves. AGREE: all 3 reviewers concur (high confidence). CHALLENGE: dissent identified. CONNECT: 2+ reviewers raise overlapping findings (corroboration). SURFACE: minority view emitted explicitly so human can weigh. Verdict + confidence + moves array emitted for richer downstream triage.
- **C5 Sandbox runtime:** Documented sandbox tempdir pattern in `.claude/agents/vg-build-task-executor/SKILL.md` for tests touching shared state (DB, ports, /tmp). Mirrors mkdtemp + env scrub from CrossAI runners. Build executor delegation reminds about sandbox choice.
- **C6 Min-budget floor:** New `scripts/vg-budget-tracker.py` tracks token cost per phase across 6 model classes (Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5, gpt-5.5, gpt-5.4, gemini-2.5-pro). New `min_budget_floor_usd: 10.00` field synced across 3 vg.config template copies. Subcommands: `track` (record event), `check` (return rc=1 + cost when over floor). Hook for orchestrator abort on overrun.

### Test coverage
**25 new tests across 6 suites.** All pass. Zero regression.

### Migration
- **C1-C3:** Transparent enhancements. No migration.
- **C4 discourse:** Aggregator output shape extended (now includes `moves` array). Downstream consumers reading `verdict` continue to work; tools wanting discourse detail read new `moves`.
- **C5 sandbox:** Documentation only — implementers opt in per task.
- **C6 budget:** Per-config opt-in via `min_budget_floor_usd` field. Default behavior unchanged (no floor → no abort).
- **C2 QA-Checker:** severity=warn (advisory) in v2.68.0. Will flip to block in v2.69.0 after telemetry shows verdict distribution + false-positive rate.

## v2.67.0 — Dogfood Issues Batch 2 (2026-05-10)

### Bug fixes (closes 7 PrintwayV3 dogfood issues batch 2)
- **#157 CRITICAL:** API contract probe parser now matches `WS|WEBSOCKET` in all 3 regexes (HEADER_RE + TABLE_ROW_RE + SPLIT_FILE_HEAD_RE). WS endpoints return SKIP verdict (not GET-probed). New `_openapi_schema_valid()` pre-gate exits 2 when `openapi-generation.log` shows FST_ERR_INVALID_SCHEMA / 500.
- **#158 HIGH:** Lens artifacts (LENS-DISPATCH-PLAN.json + LENS-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md) now have tightened `content_min_bytes` (500/300) + `content_required_sections` enforcement. Codex skill (`codex-skills/vg-review/SKILL.md`) emits lens markers per A9 pattern (`2b3_lens_dispatch_complete`, `2b3_lens_matrix_rendered`).
- **#159 HIGH:** Validator inventory loops (`verify-contract-completeness.py`) now exclude `_backup`, `archive`, `legacy`, `_archive`, `.vg` directories via centralized `_should_skip_path()` helper. New `scanned_models_count`, `scanned_jobs_count`, `scanned_webhooks_count` metrics in JSON output for cross-artifact reconciliation.
- **#160 HIGH:** GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX BLOCKED status now classified into 5 reasons via `BlockedReason` enum: APP_BLOCKED (route to /vg:build), WORKFLOW_BLOCKED (probe/tool bug), PREREQ_MISSING (route to /vg:amend), EXTERNAL_REQUIRED (operator action), PROBE_INVALID (probe bug). Auto-fix routing only sends APP_BLOCKED to /vg:build; surfaces actionable hints for the other 4 reasons inline.
- **#161 HIGH:** Phase 0.5 preflight adds 3 BLOCK gates: routes-static.json validity (`jq` route count > 0), ENV-CONTRACT.md `preflight_checks:` section, OpenAPI schema validity log scan (`FST_ERR_INVALID_SCHEMA|HTTP/x.x 500`). Each gate emits `review.preflight_pN_*` telemetry.
- **#162 MEDIUM:** Envelope drift findings now route via `ALWAYS_ROUTE_FINDING_TYPES` set (bypasses severity floor). Same treatment for `openapi_invalid`, `auth_misconfigured`, `prereq_missing` finding types. `should_route(finding)` is single source of truth (`filter_findings()` delegates).
- **#163 MEDIUM:** Security baseline validator now emits Evidence with severity field (TLS=CRITICAL, HSTS=HIGH, cookies=MEDIUM, plus complete map for 9 evidence types: CORS-wildcard-credentials=CRITICAL, secret-in-example=CRITICAL, etc.). New `merge_to_review_findings()` writes security findings into REVIEW-FINDINGS.json with `finding_type: security_baseline`. Severity field added to `_common.Evidence` (backwards-compatible — benefits all validators).

### Test coverage
**31 new tests across 7 suites.** All pass. Zero regression on v2.66.x.

### Migration
Bug fixes only — no migration needed. Existing reviews automatically benefit on next /vg:review run.

### Closes 15/15 PrintwayV3 dogfood issues
With v2.67.0, all PrintwayV3 dogfood issues from 2026-05-09 are closed (8 batch 1 in v2.66.x + 7 batch 2 in v2.67.0 = 15 total).

## v2.66.1 — Plan-fidelity followup + 2 deferred issues (2026-05-10)

### Bug fixes (closes 2 deferred dogfood issues — ALL 8/8 closed)
- **#153 MEDIUM:** Review aggregator now clusters findings by API endpoint shape via new `cluster_by_api_endpoint()` + `normalize_api_endpoint()` in `scripts/derive-findings.py`. 1 missing backend endpoint → 1 ROOT finding (severity escalated to MAJOR) + N child references — instead of N MINOR leaves that hid the upstream root cause. Findings without `api_endpoint` key pass through unchanged.
- **#154 MEDIUM:** `crossai_review.done` marker write now verdict-gated via new shared writer `scripts/crossai-marker-write.py`. When verdict ∈ {pass, flag, ok, partial} AND `ok_count > 0` → `.done` (exit 0). Otherwise → `.inconclusive` (exit 2) so `/vg:next` re-runs CrossAI on subsequent invocations.

### Plan-fidelity (B2-B4)
- **B2:** Implementer (`.claude/agents/vg-build-task-executor/SKILL.md`) RELAXED — may ask questions when capsule + plan slice are genuinely ambiguous (was: forbidden absolutely). Added mandatory 7-item self-review checklist before commit (scope creep, missing tests, mirror byte-identity, no VERSION bump, no --no-verify/amend, test count matches spec).
- **B3:** Planner (`.claude/agents/vg-blueprint-planner/SKILL.md`) now enforces 5-step TDD task body structure (failing test → confirm FAIL → minimal impl → confirm PASS → mirror + commit). Required for all `PLAN/task-NN.md` outputs.
- **B4:** New `.claude/agents/vg-build-final-reviewer/SKILL.md` cumulative reviewer agent. Runs once at end of build (STEP 7.1.5 in `commands/vg/_shared/build/close.md`), reads PLAN.md goal + entire phase commit range + L-gate results. Verdict: PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL. Severity=warn (advisory in v2.66.1). Will flip to block in v2.67.0 after telemetry calibration.

### Test coverage
**14 new tests across 5 suites.** All pass. Zero regression on v2.66.0 + prior.

### Migration
- **#153/#154:** Transparent bug fixes. No migration.
- **B2/B3/B4:** Behavioral changes only affect new builds. Existing in-progress phases unaffected. v2.67.0 will tighten B4 to blocking — operators have one minor cycle to adapt.

### Closes 8/8 dogfood issues
With v2.66.1, all 8 PrintwayV3 dogfood issues from 2026-05-09 are closed. Roadmap continues with v2.67.0 C-tier strict review research adoptions (Evidence Gate + QA-Checker + Discourse + Sandbox + Hybrid + Min-budget).

## v2.66.0 — Plan-fidelity B1 + CrossAI hotfix bundle + Prereq strict (2026-05-09)

### Breaking changes
- **C4 #152 #156:** Prereq verifier strict default ON. Was lenient by default → cascade of 31 runtime 404s when upstream patches DEFERRED. Opt-out via `--lenient-prereqs` flag. Strict-only Check E (upstream prereq verification) cannot be lenient-exempted.

### Bug fixes (closes 6 GitHub issues from PrintwayV3 dogfood)
- **#149 CRITICAL:** crossai-runner path quoting — workspace path with spaces broke stdin pipe to all CLIs. Now uses `shlex.quote()` for context + prompt substitution.
- **#150 HIGH:** Codex CLI invoke template missing `--skip-git-repo-check` — added flag + sandbox config to match build-crossai-loop parity.
- **#151 HIGH:** Gemini self-signed cert error swallowed as `auth_missing` — new `tls_self_signed` classifier (ordered before `auth_missing` for first-match-wins) + actionable hint pointing to `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` workaround.
- **#152 CRITICAL:** Lenient prereq gate — flipped to strict default (BREAKING). Both BLOCK and WARN trigger exit 1 unless `--lenient-prereqs` flag passed.
- **#155 LOW:** Codex banner text leaked into result XML — strip Codex CLI banner (everything before second `--------` separator + prompt echo) before persisting via new `_strip_codex_banner()` helper.
- **#156 CRITICAL:** Scope step doesn't enforce upstream amendment for cross-phase prereqs — added Check E (BLOCK) that scans owner phase SPECS.md/PLAN.md for declared prereq symbols. Missing → demand `/vg:amend ${owner_phase}` or patch phase before continuing. Cannot be lenient-exempted.

### Features
- **B1:** Per-task spec compliance reviewer — new `.claude/agents/vg-build-spec-reviewer/SKILL.md` agent invoked after L-gates per implemented task. Strictly verifies code matches PLAN.md spec (separate from code quality). Wired in build STEP 5.1 (severity: warn — informational signal until v2.67.0 telemetry-driven flip).

### Test coverage
**24 new tests across 7 suites.** All pass.

### Migration
- **C4 BREAKING:** Existing scope steps without `--lenient-prereqs` will now BLOCK on prereq violations. To preserve v2.65.x behavior, pass `--lenient-prereqs` per invocation. Cannot lenient-exempt Check E (upstream prereq verification) — must run `/vg:amend ${owner_phase}` or insert patch phase.
- **B1 informational:** Default severity=warn. New per-task reviewer runs but doesn't block until v2.67.0 telemetry-driven flip.
- **#149-#155 transparent:** crossai-runner fixes are bug fixes — no migration needed.

### Deferred to v2.66.1
- **#153** review aggregator clustering by API contract
- **#154** crossai_review.done marker semantics
- **B2-B4** remaining plan-fidelity (questions+self-review, TDD plan structure, in-build final reviewer)

## v2.65.0 — Codex review speed + state-shortcut hardening (2026-05-09)

### Breaking changes
- **A7:** Phase 2b-2 deepscan now default ON. Was OPT-IN since v2.42.4 → reviews silently skipped deepscan even when stale state present. Opt-out: `--skip-deepscan` flag OR `CONFIG_REVIEW_DEEPSCAN_DEFAULT: off` in vg.config.md. Adds ~30-90s to review wall time but catches state drift bugs missed in v2.64.x. Legacy `--with-deepscan` and `--full-scan` flags still parsed but are no-ops (deepscan runs anyway); `--with-deepscan` emits a deprecation notice.

### Performance (Codex review slowness fixes)
- **A1:** `scripts/spawn_recursive_probe.py` now supports `--parallel N` for ThreadPoolExecutor lens probe dispatch. Default 1 (sequential, full back-compat). Set `parallel_workers` in vg.config.md to opt in. Includes `--mock-mode` for deterministic tests + partial-failure handling (`exit_code: -3` sentinel for worker exceptions, homogeneous error dict shape — same shape as timeout/notfound paths).
- **A2:** `scripts/review-api-contract-probe.py` adds `probe_endpoints()` wrapper with `--parallel N` flag. Same ThreadPoolExecutor pattern as A1 with `ProbeResult` dataclass error shape (`verdict=FAIL, status=0, detail=worker_raise:...`).
- **A3:** `codex-inline` scanner can now spawn `N × commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` for non-MCP classification work over captured snapshots when `parallel_workers > 1`. MCP/browser actions stay inline (codex-spawn lacks MCP). Haiku model remains Claude-only.
- **A6:** Phase 3 fix-loop dual-path: Claude runtime uses `Agent` tool (existing behavior), Codex runtime uses `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write`. Branch on `VG_RUNTIME` at `commands/vg/review.md:5886-5894`.

### Correctness
- **A4:** Fix-loop max iterations bumped from 3 → 5. Each iteration emits `review.fix_iteration_started` telemetry event with `{iter, max_iter, violations}` metadata for mid-loop progress visibility.
- **A8:** `RUNTIME-MAP.json` and `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md` now declared with `must_be_created_in_run: true` + `check_provenance: true` in `commands/vg/review.md:25-47` runtime_contract. Previously stale artifacts from a prior run could be reused — exactly the state-shortcut bypass user reported ("chỉ đọc state là bỏ qua luôn deepscan trong khi còn cả 1 tá lỗi"). `_verify_artifact_run_binding` enforces sha256 + creator_run_id + source_inputs against per-run manifest. `api-docs-check.txt` and `api-contract-precheck.txt` already had these flags; A8 closes the RUNTIME-MAP + COVERAGE-MATRIX gap.
- **A9:** Codex skills (`codex-skills/{vg-build, vg-review, vg-test, vg-deploy, vg-accept, vg-blueprint, vg-scope}/SKILL.md`) now manually emit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` for every HARD marker declared in their corresponding `commands/vg/{cmd}.md` `must_touch_markers:` list. Codex has no PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks, so previously the orchestrator only saw 8/39 markers — contract validator rejected runs as silent-skip. Each skill now has a `<HARD-GATE-CODEX>` reminder block + inline mark-step bash invocations per step. **77 HARD markers across 7 skills** explicitly emitted.

### Configuration
- **A5:** New `parallel_workers: 5` field in `vg.config.template.md` (default 5). Caps concurrent workers for A1, A2, A3 ops. Set to 1 to disable parallelism (full back-compat with v2.64.x sequential behavior). Higher values (8-12) recommended on multi-core boxes with good network.

### Migration
- **A7 breaking:** Existing reviews without `--skip-deepscan` will now run Phase 2b-2 (deepscan) by default. To preserve old behavior, set `CONFIG_REVIEW_DEEPSCAN_DEFAULT: off` in your vg.config.md OR pass `--skip-deepscan` per invocation.
- **A1/A2/A3 opt-in:** Default `parallel_workers: 5` in template, but if your existing `vg.config.md` doesn't have the field, parallel ops fall back to sequential (default `parallel=1` on the Python scripts). Add `parallel_workers: N` to enable.
- **A9 codex-skills:** Existing Codex sessions will need to update their `codex-skills/` from this release for marker compliance. Old skills will continue to work but contract validator will report missing markers and reject runs.

### Test coverage
**62 new tests across 9 task suites:** `test_recursive_probe_parallel.py` (4), `test_api_contract_probe_parallel.py` (3), `test_codex_inline_parallel.py` (4), `test_review_fix_loop_progress.py` (3), `test_parallel_workers_config.py` (4), `test_review_fix_loop_dual_path.py` (4), `test_deepscan_default_on.py` (6), `test_runtime_map_enforcement.py` (19), `test_codex_marker_coverage.py` (15). All pass.

## v2.64.1 — Hotfix: 3-layer split parser bugs (2026-05-09)

### Bug fixes (closes 6 GitHub issues from darwin user)

| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| #148 | HIGH | `matrix-merger.sh` TOTAL=0 with 60 goals (review FALSE-PASS). Now supports index table + split files. |
| #146/#145/#144 | medium | `review-api-contract-probe.py` parses 3-layer split format (table + per-endpoint files). |
| #143 | medium | `generate-api-docs.py` same parser fix (via `api_docs_common.parse_contract_sections`). |
| #147 | medium | `verify-contract-completeness` profile-aware scope (skips BE artifacts on FE-only phases). |

### Root cause

Parsers expected legacy `## METHOD /path` heading + `## Goal G-XX:` block formats. v2.63.0 D1 + earlier blueprint changes shifted artifacts to 3-layer split (Layer 2 index table + Layer 1 per-file). Old parsers returned 0 endpoints/goals → silent FALSE-PASS or incorrect warnings.

### Fix strategy

Multi-format fallback: try legacy → table → split. Return whichever finds non-zero results.

No breaking changes. Legacy phases continue to parse via heading/block. New phases parse via table or split.

### Tests

`tests/test_hotfix_v2_64_1_parser_bugs.py` — 10 cases covering all 4 fixes plus regression coverage for legacy formats.

## v2.64.0 — F5 Workflow tracer (full impl) (2026-05-09)

### Closing the last deferred item from RTB blueprint→build investigation

| Component | Commit | File |
|---|---|---|
| **Validator** | `ce620dd` | `scripts/validators/verify-workflow-evidence.py` |
| **L4_workflow gate wire** | `12d23b2` | `commands/vg/_shared/build/post-execution-delegation.md`, `post-execution-overview.md`, `commands/vg/build.md` |
| **Design doc (predecessor)** | `cdc6440` | `docs/plans/2026-05-09-f5-workflow-tracer-design.md` |

### What it does

User pain: even with v2.62.0 F3 (FORM-API-MAP field cross-ref) + v2.63.0 F4 (auto-wire), bugs slip through. Forms post correctly but `setState` never called → UI stuck on loading. Fetch succeeds but `.then()` missing → response shape never parsed.

F5 catches **wiring bugs across components**, not field-name bugs. For each step in `${PHASE_DIR}/WORKFLOW-SPECS/WF-NN.md` (produced by /vg:blueprint Pass 3), validator searches FE + BE source trees for matching code patterns.

### How it works

`verify-workflow-evidence.py` runs lexical AST search (regex-based, pure stdlib + optional pyyaml — no tree-sitter, no babel). For each workflow step:

- **User clicks** → `onClick={fn}`, `button[type=submit]`, `on:click=`
- **FE validate** → `handleSubmit`, `useForm`, `zod.parse`, `yup.|joi.`
- **FE HTTP** → `fetch('/api/x', {method:'POST'})`, `axios.post|get|put|patch|delete`
- **FE response handler** → `.then()`, `await fetch`, `onSuccess:`
- **FE state update** → `setState`, `set[A-Z]\w*`, `dispatch`
- **FE cache invalidate** → `invalidateQueries`, `mutate`, `refetch`
- **FE navigation** → `navigate()`, `router.push`, `history.push`
- **BE routes** → `router.post|get|put|patch|delete('/path')`, `app.METHOD`, `@post` decorators (Express, Fastify, Flask, FastAPI)
- **BE persistence** → ORM `.save()/.create()/.update()`, raw SQL, prisma ops

URL/method matching with path normalization (`:id`, `{id}`, `${var}` → `:param`).

### Output

`${PHASE_DIR}/WORKFLOW-EVIDENCE/<wf-id>.json` per workflow:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "WF-001",
  "phase": "7.14",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_idx": 0,
      "actor": "user",
      "action": "click submit",
      "evidence": {"file": "...", "line": 42, "anchor": "onClick={handleSubmit}"},
      "status": "found"
    },
    {
      "step_idx": 4,
      "actor": "FE",
      "action": "handle response",
      "evidence": null,
      "status": "missing",
      "missing_reason": "no .then() / await response handler within scope"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {"total_steps": 6, "found": 4, "missing": 2, "drift_severity": "warn"}
}
```

Status taxonomy: `found`, `missing`, `divergent`, `ambiguous`, `skipped`.

### Strict mode (per user §9.3 decision)

`VG_BUILD_L4_WORKFLOW_STRICT=true` → BLOCKs on **both** `missing` and `divergent` steps. Default warn-only — drift detected but build proceeds.

### Wired automatically into post-execution

New `L4_workflow` gate in `gates_passed[]` (parallel to v2.63.0 F4 `L4_form`):
- Runs after L4_form
- Skips when `${PHASE_DIR}/WORKFLOW-SPECS.md` absent (legacy phase or no flows)
- Skips for non-FE/BE profiles (infra, docs, hotfix, bugfix, migration)
- Emit `build.l4_workflow_completed` (severity warn)
- Emit `build.l4_workflow_skipped` (severity warn) when no workflows

### TSX-only for v2.64.0 (per user §9.2 decision)

Vue support is lexical-only (extract `<script>` block then regex). Full Vue SFC parsing deferred to v2.64.1 per design §6b. Svelte/SolidJS unsupported — emit `skipped` with `unsupported_framework`.

### Test additions

~16 new pytest assertions across 2 files:
- `tests/test_workflow_evidence.py` (8 tests)
- `tests/test_l4_workflow_gate_wired.py` (8 tests)

### Migration

No breaking changes:
- F5 warn-only by default. Existing builds pass through unchanged.
- Set `VG_BUILD_L4_WORKFLOW_STRICT=true` to opt into BLOCK mode.
- Phases without `WORKFLOW-SPECS.md` (pre-Pass 3 blueprint or no multi-actor flows) skip silently.

### Cumulative test count

v2.63.0 baseline + ~16 new = ~286+ pytest assertions covering meta-memory v1.1 + supply-chain gates + tasklist UX + post-wave continuation + RTB quality + workflow tracer.

### Deferred to v2.64.1+

- Full Vue SFC parsing (currently lexical script-only)
- Svelte/SolidJS framework support
- Runtime workflow trace (instrumentation-based, alternative to static AST)
- Temporal order verification (step 2 before step 5 in execution)

## v2.63.0 — UI-SPEC per-slug split + L4_form auto-wire (2026-05-09)

### Bug fix — Closing 2 deferred items from v2.62.0 RTB investigation

| Fix | Drift | Commit | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1** UI-SPEC per-slug split | Architectural sampling cap (`Sample 2-3 representative`) | `410ee5d` | `commands/vg/_shared/blueprint/design.md`, `commands/vg/blueprint.md`, `scripts/vg-load.sh` |
| **F4** L4_form auto-wire | v2.62.0 F3 verifier was opt-in only | `655336e` | `commands/vg/_shared/build/post-execution-delegation.md`, `commands/vg/_shared/build/post-execution-overview.md`, `commands/vg/build.md` |

### D1 details (UI-SPEC per-slug split)

Old behavior: agent prompt at `_shared/blueprint/design.md:264` instructed `Sample design refs (2-3 representative *.structural.html + *.interactions.md)`. Pages 4+ in multi-page phases had no markup evidence in UI-SPEC. F1 (v2.62.0) added top-5 verbatim cap but the architectural sampling remained.

Fix: 3-layer split matching API-CONTRACTS / PLAN / TEST-GOALS:

```
${PHASE_DIR}/UI-SPEC.md           ← Layer 3 flat (legacy compat, post-agent concat)
${PHASE_DIR}/UI-SPEC/index.md     ← Layer 2 table of contents
${PHASE_DIR}/UI-SPEC/<slug>.md    ← Layer 1 per-slug split
```

Build executors load only what's needed via:

```
vg-load --artifact ui-spec --slug <slug>
```

Falls back to flat UI-SPEC.md when per-slug file missing (legacy phase). Context scales linearly with slug count — no architectural budget cap.

### F4 details (L4_form auto-wire)

v2.62.0 F3 shipped `verify-form-api-field-match.py` as opt-in. F4 wires it into the automatic post-execution sequence run by `vg-build-post-executor` subagent.

New gate `L4_form` added to `gates_passed[]`:
- Runs `verify-form-api-field-match.py` with `--evidence-out`
- Default mode: warn-only (drift = WARN telemetry, does NOT BLOCK)
- Strict mode opt-in via `VG_BUILD_L4_FORM_STRICT=true` env var
- Skips when `${PHASE_DIR}/FORM-API-MAP.md` missing (legacy phase, emits `build.l4_form_skipped`)
- Skips silently for non-FE profiles (backend-only, infra, docs, hotfix)

Telemetry events declared in `build.md` must_emit_telemetry:
- `build.l4_form_completed` (severity warn)
- `build.l4_form_skipped` (severity warn)

### Test additions

~18 new pytest assertions across 2 files:
- `tests/test_ui_spec_per_slug_split.py` (10 tests)
- `tests/test_l4_form_gate_wired.py` (8 tests)

### Migration

No breaking changes:
- D1: existing flat `UI-SPEC.md` still works (Layer 3 maintained for legacy validators). New per-slug split is additive — phases pre-D1 won't break, just won't get the per-slug split until next /vg:blueprint run.
- F4: warn-only by default. Existing builds pass through unchanged. Set `VG_BUILD_L4_FORM_STRICT=true` to opt into BLOCK mode.

### Deferred to v2.64+

- **F5** (Workflow tracer — submit → API → response → state → UI evidence chain) requires per-step file:line evidence schema. Deferred until design solidifies.

### Cumulative test count

v2.62.0 baseline + ~18 new = ~270+ pytest assertions.

## v2.62.0 — RTB blueprint→build quality bundle (2026-05-09)

### Bug fix — Supply chain quality

User pain (verbatim from session): 'AI có vẻ không làm theo HTML, việc call các request giữa FE và BE vẫn còn lỗi, đơn giản như bấm save form thôi cũng lỗi nhiều loại.'

Investigation across harness code confirmed 4 drift points (D1-D4) in the blueprint → build supply chain. This release ships fixes for **D2/D3/D4**.

### 3-fix bundle (commits)

| Fix | Drift Point | Commit | File(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** UI-SPEC verbatim markup | **D2** Lossy text-summary | `745677f` | `commands/vg/_shared/blueprint/design.md` |
| **F2** Capsule MUST READ structural.html | **D3** Silent path reference | `7ba8fdf` | `scripts/pre-executor-check.py` |
| **F3** FORM-API-MAP generator + verifier | **D4** No FE form ↔ API field cross-ref | `4feb86f` | `scripts/blueprint-form-api-map.py`, `scripts/validators/verify-form-api-field-match.py`, `commands/vg/blueprint.md` |

### F1 details (D2 fix)

Blueprint UI-SPEC agent prompt previously instructed text-summary references like `Markup: <button class=...> (from {slug}.structural.html#btn-primary)` — lossy. Now mandates verbatim markup paste for top-5 forms + top-3 interactive components per phase. Ellipsis (`...`) explicitly forbidden in markup blocks. Cap (default 5/3) controls bloat — opt-out via `vg.config.md → blueprint.ui_spec_verbatim_cap: <int>`.

Forms section template now emits actual ` ```html ` fenced blocks plus a derived field-summary table, so build executors get byte-accurate `<input name="...">` attrs, types, required attrs, validation patterns.

### F2 details (D3 fix)

`scripts/pre-executor-check.py` design-context block previously emitted a passive `Structural ref: {path}` line inside the PNG per-slug list. Compare PNG handling: explicit `Read: {path}` + `READ EACH PATH WITH THE Read TOOL BEFORE WRITING CODE` mandate.

New parallel section `## Structural HTML — READ EACH PATH AND COPY MARKUP VERBATIM` matches PNG strength. Section text explains:
- Field name drift consequences (`user_email` ≠ `email` = save form 422)
- Hidden inputs / CSRF / ARIA / validation pattern preservation
- Forward-references UI-SPEC `## Forms` (F1) + `FORM-API-MAP.md` + verifier (F3)

### F3 details (D4 fix)

NEW `scripts/blueprint-form-api-map.py` runs during `/vg:blueprint` Pass 4 (after BLOCK 5). Parses structural.html `<form>` elements (action, method, input/select/textarea name attrs, types, validation patterns) × API-CONTRACTS request schemas. Emits `${PHASE_DIR}/FORM-API-MAP.md` with per-form table flagging:
- `✓` clean match
- `⚠ NAME-DRIFT` (snake_case ↔ camelCase, fully different name)
- `◇ HEADER` (CSRF tokens, hidden meta inputs)

Match strategy: exact → case-insensitive → snake_case ↔ camelCase normalize. Mismatches after normalization = drift. Forms without `action=` (client-side only) skipped.

NEW `scripts/validators/verify-form-api-field-match.py` runs during `/vg:build` post-execution. Reads FORM-API-MAP.md + walks FE codegen for `.tsx/.jsx/.vue/.html` files. Compares actual `<input name="...">` attrs vs FORM-API-MAP expected. Emits BuildWarningEvidence (severity=warn default; BLOCK with `--strict`). Full L4-form gate integration deferred to v2.63.

`commands/vg/blueprint.md` declares FORM-API-MAP.md in `must_write` with `profile_aware: true` (skipped for non-FE profiles) and `required_unless_flag: '--skip-form-api-map'`.

### Test additions

~24 new pytest assertions across 3 files:
- `tests/test_ui_spec_verbatim_markup.py` (7 tests)
- `tests/test_capsule_html_mandatory_read.py` (6 tests)
- `tests/test_form_api_map.py` (11 tests)

### Migration

No breaking changes:
- F1 cap is additive (default 5 forms / 3 components verbatim).
- F2 strengthens design-context output text — no contract change.
- F3 introduces new artifact `FORM-API-MAP.md`. `profile_aware: true` skips for non-FE profiles. `severity: warn` keeps advisory until `--skip-form-api-map` removed in v2.63.

### Deferred to v2.63+

- **D1** (UI-SPEC samples only 2-3 structural.html refs per phase) requires per-component split-file pattern. Architectural — tracked for v2.63.
- **F4** (Verifier L7 — parse FE output vs structural.html, hard gate) — full pipeline integration when FORM-API-MAP.md is mandatory.
- **F5** (Workflow tracer — submit → API → response → state → UI) — needs evidence flow tracking.

## v2.61.0 — Post-wave continuation defense in depth (2026-05-09)

### Bug fix — Post-wave continuation

User pain (verbatim): 'build xong phase theo từng wave, tới wave cuối chạy xong, không thấy kích hoạt các bước còn lại của build, lại phải ra lệnh bằng prompt thuần.'

After last wave Agent returns, AI ended turn instead of continuing to STEP 5/6/6.5/7. Same pattern affected `/vg:test`, `/vg:accept`, `/vg:deploy`.

### 3-layer defense (commits)

| Layer | Commit | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **L1** | `04b6b09` | Primer Red Flags — 6 rationalizations injected via SessionStart primer (`scripts/hooks/vg-meta-skill.md`) |
| **L2** | `b59841e` | PostToolUse hook reminder — active stderr emit when wave Agent returns + post-step marker missing (`scripts/hooks/vg-post-tool-use-agent.sh`) |
| **L3** | `ccba53b` | MANDATORY entry block — explicit instruction in `commands/vg/{build,test,accept,deploy}.md` |

### Wave executor → marker map (L2)

| Subagent type | Command | Post-step marker |
|---|---|---|
| `vg-build-task-executor` | vg:build | `9_post_execution` |
| `vg-test-codegen` | vg:test | `5c_goal_verification` |
| `vg-test-goal-verifier` | vg:test | `write_report` |
| `vg-deploy-executor` | vg:deploy | `2_persist_summary` |
| `vg-accept-uat-builder` | vg:accept | `5_interactive_uat` |

### Bonus fixes in L2

- Stripped trailing `\r` from harvested paths — silent failure on Windows Python for #140 intent-to-add.
- Switched to `vg_resolve_session_id_from_input` to honor subagent session isolation (#135/#136).

### Test additions

~18 new pytest assertions across 3 files (`tests/test_meta_skill_post_wave_red_flags.py`, `tests/test_post_wave_reminder.py`, `tests/test_post_wave_mandatory_block.py`).

### Migration

No breaking changes. Hooks always exit 0. Entry blocks are additive. Existing flows continue working — additions are reminders + explicit instructions.

### Cumulative test count

v2.60.0 baseline + ~18 new = ~225+ pytest assertions.

## v2.60.0 — Tasklist UX + intent primer (2026-05-09)

### Tasklist UX (F1 + F2)

User pain (verbatim from session): "wave đang chạy, bị hết limit vì lý do gì đó mà tasklist mất. khi tôi khôi phục lại phiên, tasklist chỉ hiện 1 next task duy nhất, không khôi phục lại tasklist. Hơn nữa Tasklist không update các task đang làm, chuẩn bị làm lên đầu."

| Feature | File | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **F1 SessionStart auto-restore** | `scripts/hooks/vg-session-start.sh` + `scripts/emit-tasklist.py --restore-mode` + new `scripts/hooks/vg-tasklist-snapshot.py` | On `resume`/`compact` event, if active VG run + `tasklist-contract.json` exist, append restoration markdown to `additionalContext` instructing AI to immediately re-project the full tasklist via TodoWrite. Snapshot statuses preserved. |
| **F2 TodoWrite re-order by status** | `scripts/emit-tasklist.py` `reorder_projection_by_status()` + `scripts/hooks/vg-post-tool-use-todowrite.sh` snapshot wire | Within each group: `in_progress` → `pending` → `completed`. Group header status auto-reflects step states. After every TodoWrite call, `.vg/runs/{run_id}/.todowrite-snapshot.json` captures latest state for F1 restore. |

### Intent recognition (Task 3)

User pain: "build phase X bằng VG đi" — natural language requests don't trigger VG slash commands. AI writes code by hand instead of invoking `/vg:build`.

`scripts/hooks/vg-meta-skill.md` adds two sections injected on every SessionStart:

- **Intent → Command map** — 17 entries mapping English + Vietnamese phrases ("build phase X" / "lập plan cho phase X" / "rà code" / "đẩy lên" / "tiến độ" / etc.) to `/vg:*` commands. Includes disambiguation rules and fallback for non-matching requests.
- **Red Flags — Intent recognition** — 6 rationalizations AI uses to skip the map ("I'll just write code directly", "/vg:debug overkill for one file") with reality responses.

Primer file size: 13KB / 20KB budget — well under SessionStart context limit.

### Test additions (~25 new pytest assertions)

- `tests/test_tasklist_session_restore.py` (7 tests)
- `tests/test_todowrite_reorder.py` (10 tests)
- `tests/test_meta_skill_intent_table.py` (8 tests)

### Migration

No breaking changes:
- F1 restore activates only on resume/compact when active run exists. Fresh sessions unaffected.
- F2 reorder applies via emit-tasklist.py — visible immediately to all users.
- Intent map is additive guidance — AI behavior gradually improves; no command surface change.

v2.59.0 baseline + ~25 new = ~205+ pytest assertions.

## v2.59.0 — Supply chain bug fixes + meta-memory helper (2026-05-09)

Patch-style minor release. 3 P0/HIGH bug fixes confirmed by 2-agent supply-chain audit + 2 meta-memory dogfood enablers (helper command + Stop hook reminder). No breaking changes; meta-memory remains opt-in (default `disabled`).

### Bug fixes (3 P0/HIGH confirmed by 2-agent supply-chain audit)

| ID | File | Fix | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0-1** | `commands/vg/_shared/build/close.md:540` | Write `steps.build.status = "built-complete"` instead of `"done"` | Deploy whitelist accepts `{accepted, tested, reviewed, built-with-debt, built-complete, complete}`. `"done"` was NOT in whitelist → every `/vg:deploy` hard-blocked unless `--allow-build-incomplete`. Commit `4c238ef`. |
| **P0-2** | `commands/vg/build.md` (must_write) | Declare `${PHASE_DIR}/PIPELINE-STATE.json` with `content_required_sections: ["steps.build.status", "built-complete"]` | PIPELINE-STATE.json consumed by deploy/review/test/accept but missing from every must_write contract. Resume after compact silently broke downstream gates. Commit `fc4cc1f`. |
| **#142** | `scripts/vg-orchestrator/{contracts,__main__}.py` + `commands/vg/review.md` | Add `profile_aware: bool` field (default true). Review wraps `RUNTIME-MAP.json` + `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md` with `profile_aware: false` | `_PROFILE_REQUIRED_ARTIFACTS["feature"]` omitted both files → orchestrator silently downgraded missing must_write to WARN → review emit `run.completed PASS` even when must_write violated. Reproducer: phase 7.15 run_id `de16229c` (linux, vg 2.52.2). Commit `31e01ce`. |

### Features

- **`/vg:meta-memory enable|disable|reflect-only|status`** (commit `db7e062`) — slash command + Python helper for safe `meta_memory_mode` flag control. Atomic write via `tempfile.replace`. Initializes from template if config absent. Replaces error-prone manual edits of `.claude/vg.config.md`.
- **Stop hook soft reminder — Hướng C** (commit `a95b68d`) — when `meta_memory_mode != "disabled"` AND `bootstrap-consolidate.py --check-gate` exits 0 (24h + 5 sessions accumulated), Stop hook prints once-per-session reminder: `🌙 Meta-memory: consolidation gate met. Run /vg:learn --consolidate --apply to merge promoted rules.` Does NOT auto-mutate — user remains in control.

### Test additions (~30 new pytest assertions)

- `tests/test_build_deploy_status_handoff.py` (3 tests)
- `tests/test_pipeline_state_must_write.py` (4 tests)
- `tests/test_profile_aware_must_write.py` (8 tests)
- `tests/test_meta_memory_set.py` (10 tests)
- `tests/test_dream_reminder.py` (10 tests)

### Migration

No breaking changes:
- Build status transition (P0-1) only affects new `/vg:build` runs. Existing PIPELINE-STATE.json files with `"done"` status will be overwritten on next build.
- PIPELINE-STATE.json must_write enforcement (P0-2) tightens the gate but build already writes the file inline — no behavior change beyond gate visibility.
- profile_aware field (#142) defaults `true` for back-compat. Only review's RUNTIME-MAP + COVERAGE-MATRIX flip to `false`. Other commands unaffected.
- Meta-memory features remain opt-in via `meta_memory_mode` flag (default `disabled`). v2.59.0 ships dogfood helper but doesn't flip the default.

### Cumulative test count

v2.58.0 baseline + ~30 new = ~180+ pytest assertions covering meta-memory v1.1 + supply-chain gates.

## v2.58.0 - Meta-memory v1.1 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE — Stage 6 (rollout flag + E2E + docs)

Minor release. Stage 6 closes meta-memory v1.1 — rollout flag + E2E tests + cross-platform smoke + final docs. **All 6 stages of meta-memory v1.1 SHIPPED.**

### Stage 6 commits (5 atomic)

| Task | Commit | Topic |
|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | `3b21aeb` | `meta_memory_mode` flag documented in `config-loader.md` + `vg.config.template.md`. Allowed: `disabled` (default) / `reflect-only` / `inject-as-advice` / `default` |
| 6.2 | `4e8adf2` | E2E loop test: phase 1 promote → phase 2 loader-visible. Verifies inject sites gated by flag. |
| 6.3 | `b92e13a` | Causal misattribution regression test: orchestrator rejects procedural outcome with empty `executed_step_ids[]` (Codex #9 cargo-cult prevention end-to-end) |
| 6.4 | `8d7edc7` | Cross-platform smoke: Windows + POSIX skipif markers, loader + consolidate run without crash |
| 6.5 | `115f2ea` | Section 14 added to design doc: full implementation status table. Implementation plan annotated. |

### Meta-memory v1.1 cumulative shipment (v2.53.0 → v2.58.0)

| Stage | Version | Tasks | Tests | Hard gate? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Schema + validator | v2.53.0 | 2 | 21 | — |
| 2 — 5 reflector triggers | v2.54.0 | 5 | 20 | — |
| 3 — Causal attribution | v2.55.0 | 3 | 16 | ✅ HARD GATE |
| 4 — Loader flags + 4 inject sites | v2.56.0 | 5 | 29 | — |
| 5 — Dreams 4-phase consolidation | v2.57.0 | 6 | 50+ | — |
| 6 — Rollout + E2E + docs | v2.58.0 | 5 | 10 | — |

**Total:** ~26 tasks, ~150 pytest cases, 0 regression on existing infra.

### Critical invariants validated end-to-end

- Codex #9 attribution gate (cargo-cult prevention) — 16+ tests across stages 3+5+6
- Anthropic Auto Dream patterns: MERGE in-place (NOT side-by-side), NEVER auto-retract on contradiction, MEMORY.md ≤200 lines hard cap, lock try/finally release
- Stage 3 HARD GATE: procedural rules cannot promote without attribution proof
- Default OFF rollout: `meta_memory_mode=disabled` ships everywhere; opt-in only

### Operator readiness

- `/vg:learn --consolidate [--apply]` — manual dream invocation (default dry-run)
- `vg.config.md → meta_memory_mode={disabled, reflect-only, inject-as-advice}` — opt-in rollout flag
- Future: v2.59.0 may flip default to `inject-as-advice` after dogfood validation

### Migration

No breaking changes. Existing rules without `type` field default to `declarative`. Existing 8 `bootstrap-loader.py` callers unchanged. End-users see zero behavior change until they explicitly flip `meta_memory_mode`.

### Out of scope (acknowledged in design Section 14)

- Per-project version pin (planned v3.x via `vg.config.md` field)
- mem0 MCP cross-project memory (planned but not wired)
- Plugin marketplace distribution (defer post-v3 layout stable)
- Phase 2 transcript narrow-grep (placeholder; events.db sufficient for v1)
- Drift detection beyond 30d window (additional events.db query)

### Verified

- Stage 6: 10 new pytest cases PASS
- Cumulative meta-memory: 129 pytest assertions PASS + 1 platform-skip
- 44 pre-existing failures (`test_vg_load_*`, `test_tasklist_depth_enforcement`, Winsock socket env) verified unrelated to meta-memory work
- All mirrors byte-identical (4 .md mirror pairs across stages)

### Next

v3.0.0 (global install + .vg/ root layout + deploy decouple) per `docs/plans/2026-05-09-vg-global-install-design.md` — separate plan, ~22 days estimate. Meta-memory v1.1 complete unblocks v3.x roadmap.

## v2.57.0 - Meta-memory v1.1 Stage 5: Anthropic Auto Dream consolidation engine

Minor release. Stage 5 implements Anthropic Auto Dream-style 4-phase consolidation per design Section 13.1. 6 commits — gate + lock + 4 phases + skill mode.

### Foundation (Task 5.1, commit `78c599a`)

`bootstrap-consolidate.py` script with gate + lock + state subcommands:

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--check-gate [--json]` | 24h+ AND >5 sessions both required (Anthropic Dreams pattern) |
| `--acquire-lock` | Concurrent dream prevention via `.consolidation.lock` |
| `--release-lock` | Always called from try/finally |
| `--update-state` | After successful `--apply` only |
| `--increment-sessions` | Hooked into session-start |

State at `.vg/bootstrap/state.json`. Override gates via `VG_DREAMS_GATE_HOURS` + `VG_DREAMS_GATE_SESSIONS` env vars. 8 pytest cases.

### 4 Dreams phases (Tasks 5.2-5.5, commits `111a162` + `ce11ab8` + `2a107db` + `e316ec0`)

| Phase | Commit | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Orient | `111a162` | Read `.vg/bootstrap/` snapshot: rule count, MEMORY.md size, oversized files |
| 2 — Gather | `ce11ab8` | Query events.db (last 30d/100 sessions). **Codex #9 attribution gate enforced**: drop procedural outcomes with empty `executed_step_ids[]` (cargo-cult prevention) |
| 3 — Consolidate | `2a107db` | **MERGE in-place** (NOT side-by-side, per Anthropic Dreams). Recurrence (≥3 attributed PASS) → tier-A confirm. Contradiction (PASS+FAIL ≥3 each) → log warning ONLY (NEVER auto-retract). Drift (≥30d no fire) → archive proposal in log. |
| 4 — Prune & Index | `e316ec0` | Rebuild `MEMORY.md` ≤ 200 lines (Anthropic cap). Demote verbose entries to `topics/{step}.md`. Idempotent re-runs. |

30 pytest cases across 4 phases. Default = dry-run; `--apply` flag triggers actual writes.

### Skill mode (Task 5.6, commit `7ab4c86`)

`/vg:learn --consolidate [--apply]` orchestrator subcommand `--consolidate-all`:
- Gate check → acquire lock → 4 phases (orient/gather/consolidate/prune) → update state if `--apply` → release lock (always, even on exception)
- 12 pytest cases including: lock release on phase crash, dry-run safety, gate-closed rc=0
- Documented in `commands/vg/learn.md` + `codex-skills/vg-learn/SKILL.md` (4 mirrors byte-identical)

### Critical invariants enforced

1. **Codex #9 attribution gate** — Phase 2 drops cargo-cult outcomes (procedural rules with empty `executed_step_ids[]`)
2. **MERGE not side-by-side** — Phase 3 updates `overlay.yml`/`ACCEPTED.md`/`CONSOLIDATION-LOG.md` in-place
3. **NEVER auto-retract** — Contradictions log warnings only; rule files byte-identical
4. **Default dry-run** — All 4 phases require `--apply` for filesystem writes
5. **Absolute UTC timestamps** — Phase 3 logs reject relative dates (yesterday/today)
6. **MEMORY.md ≤ 200 lines** — Anthropic cap enforced; overflow demotes to `topics/`
7. **Idempotent re-runs** — Phase 3 no double-promote; Phase 4 stable
8. **Lock try/finally** — Released even on exception (verified by monkey-patch test)

### Verified

- 50 cumulative pytest assertions across Stage 5 PASS
- 12 prior tests (consolidate test files) + 38 phase tests + adjacent attribution/loader/render tests all PASS
- All mirror pairs byte-identical
- 44 pre-existing failures (`test_vg_load_*`, `test_tasklist_depth_enforcement`) verified unrelated

### Migration

No breaking changes. `meta_memory_mode` flag still defaults `disabled`. End-users see zero behavior change.

For developers: dream consolidation is now invocable via `/vg:learn --consolidate` (dry-run) or `--consolidate --apply`. Stage 6 will wire automatic invocation per rollout flag.

### Deferred (acknowledged)

- Phase 2 transcript narrow-grep — placeholder; events.db signals sufficient for v1 rollout
- Phase 3 drift detection beyond 30d window — needs additional events.db query (rule_fired count over time); not blocking current rollout

### Next

Stage 6 (rollout flag `meta_memory_mode={disabled, reflect-only, inject-as-advice, default}` + E2E + cross-platform smoke + docs) ships v2.58-v2.59.

## v2.56.0 - Meta-memory v1.1 Stage 4: 4 inject sites + loader v1.1 flags

Minor release. Stage 4 wires bootstrap rules end-to-end into skill prompts. 5 commits (Task 4.0 foundation + 4 inject sites). Gated by `meta_memory_mode != "disabled"` (default disabled — no behavior change yet, Stage 6 flips flag).

### Task 4.0 — bootstrap-loader v1.1 flags (foundation, commit `9d3d1db`)

`bootstrap-loader.py` extended with 4 new CLI flags:

- `--target-step <step>` (repeatable) — filter by frontmatter `target_step`. `global` always matches.
- `--include-procedural` — include rules with `type=procedural` (default excludes for clean payload)
- `--filter-preconditions <json>` — substring key/value match against rule's `preconditions` block
- `--max-bytes <N>` — total budget cap, drops procedural → declarative → legacy in priority order, appends `_truncated: true` marker

Output JSON keys split rules: `rules_declarative[]` + `rules_procedural[]` + legacy `rules[]` (back-compat). 12 new pytest cases.

### Stage 4 inject sites (4 commits)

| Task | Commit | Site | Filter |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | `2980189` | build preflight STEP 1.5c → `.build-context.md` | `--target-step build,deploy --include-procedural` + phase context |
| 4.2 | `d3ee439` | deploy pre-spawn → `BOOTSTRAP_RULES_BLOCK` env var | `--target-step deploy --include-procedural` + `{env, has_dockerfile}` |
| 4.3 | `a2a707e` | accept preflight `0b_meta_memory_inject` step → `.accept-context.md` | `--target-step accept` + `{phase_type}` |
| 4.4 | `a7525a9` | `bootstrap-inject.sh` `vg_bootstrap_render_split()` helper | renders JSON → 2-section markdown |

Each inject site:
- Gated by `vg.config.md → meta_memory_mode != "disabled"` (default disabled)
- Calls loader with appropriate filters
- Renders JSON output via Python heredoc into 2-section markdown:
  - `### Declarative Rules (MUST do / MUST NOT do)`
  - `### Procedural Recipes (worked previously, ADVISORY)`
- Mirror byte-identical (canonical ↔ `.claude/`)
- Wiring tests added (5 implementer-chosen adaptations from spec)

### Implementer adaptations from plan

1. **JSON parsing via stdin pipe** (not heredoc) — quote-safe for arbitrary loader output
2. **STEP naming convention** — build uses `STEP 1.5c` (matches existing `STEP 1.X` convention, not spec's `0.5b`)
3. **Accept inject wrapped with `step-active`/`mark-step`** — preserves HARD-GATE marker discipline + telemetry events
4. **CRLF/LF line endings preserved per file** — preflight.md CRLF, bootstrap-inject.sh LF
5. **Loader output remains JSON** (not markdown) — preserves API back-compat for existing scope-based callers

### Verified

- 29 new pytest cases across 5 test files all PASS
- 51 regression assertions PASS (Stage 3 + 4 cumulative)
- Mirrors byte-identical
- 8 pre-existing test failures (`test_rcrurd_preflight_runner`, `test_preflight_invariants_runner`) verified unrelated (WinError 10106 socket env issue, identical fail at parent commit)

### Migration

No breaking changes. `meta_memory_mode` flag still defaults `disabled`. End-users see zero behavior change. Existing 8 `bootstrap-loader.py` callers unaffected (new flags opt-in only).

For developers: rules with `type: procedural` now invisible to loader by default — pass `--include-procedural` to surface them. Ensures clean payload for declarative-only callers.

### Next

Stage 5 (Dreams 4-phase consolidation: orient → gather → consolidate → prune + `/vg:learn --consolidate` mode) ships v2.57-v2.58. Stage 6 (rollout flag + E2E + flip default) ships v2.59.

## v2.55.0 - Meta-memory v1.1 Stage 3: Causal attribution HARD GATE COMPLETE

Minor release. Stage 3 of meta-memory v1.1 — the **CRITICAL HARD GATE** before Stage 4 inject sites can ship. Closes Codex #9 finding (causal misattribution → cargo-cult learning) per design Section 13.4.

### Why this stage matters

Without Stage 3, procedural rule promotion is cargo-cult: rule fires + phase passes → rule logged PASS even when executor BYPASSED sequence entirely. Shadow evaluator would auto-promote on false positives. Stage 3 closes this hole with 3 mechanisms:

| Task | Commit | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | `874a024` | `sequence_checksum` at fire time — sha256 of joined sequence cmds, attached to `bootstrap.rule_fired` event payload |
| 3.2 | `2385e4a` | Per-step execution prober — `bootstrap-attribute-outcome.py` substring-matches each cmd in deploy/test log via forward cursor |
| 3.3 | `94973ce` | Outcome event gate — `cmd_emit_event` rejects `bootstrap.outcome_recorded` for procedural rules without `metadata.attribution.executed_step_ids` |

### Task 3.1 — Sequence checksum at fire time

`commands/vg/_shared/lib/bootstrap-inject.sh`:
- NEW helper `vg_bootstrap_compute_sequence_checksum <rule_path> [--json]`
- Existing `vg_bootstrap_emit_fired` augmented per-rule loop: if rule has `_path` + `type==procedural`, re-parse rule file, attach `sequence_checksum` to event metadata
- Existing 8 callers UNCHANGED (signature preserved)
- Helper accepts both `slug:` (Stage 1 schema docs) and `id:` (loader payload format)

### Task 3.2 — Per-step execution prober

`.claude/scripts/bootstrap-attribute-outcome.py` (with mirror):
- Forward-cursor substring match enforces order (out-of-order = not counted)
- `expected_signals` matched only within 4096-byte window after each step's cmd
- Returns JSON: `{executed_step_ids[], total_steps, matched_signals_count}`
- Empty `executed_step_ids[]` = executor bypassed entirely

### Task 3.3 — Outcome event attribution gate

`vg-orchestrator emit-event` for `bootstrap.outcome_recorded`:
- Rejects rc=1 if `payload.rule_type == "procedural"` AND `payload.attribution.executed_step_ids` empty/missing
- Other event types unaffected
- Declarative rules + legacy events without `rule_type` field accepted (backwards compat)
- `event.json` schema documents attribution requirement

### Verified

- 16 new pytest cases (4 + 6 + 6 across 3 tasks) all PASS
- 75 cumulative pytest assertions PASS (all prior stages still green)
- Mirrors byte-identical (canonical ↔ `.claude/`) for bootstrap-inject.sh, bootstrap-attribute-outcome.py, vg-orchestrator/__main__.py, schemas/event.json
- No regression on Stage 1+2 work
- PyYAML 6.0.2 verified available

### Adaptations from plan

Implementer made 3 user-confirmed adaptations:
1. **Approach B1** (helper-based) instead of plan's signature-overload approach — preserves 8 existing emit_fired callers
2. **CLI flag is `--payload`** not `--metadata` (corrected from plan to match actual `cmd_emit_event` signature)
3. **Gate placement before active-run check** — otherwise "no active run" downstream would mask rejection in tests

### Migration

No breaking changes for end-users. Stage 3 mechanisms are dormant until Stage 4 wires them into inject sites. `meta_memory_mode` flag still defaults `disabled` — no behavior change.

For developers extending VG: any new procedural rule fired must now flow through the prober → outcome event must include attribution payload. Stage 4 inject sites will wire this end-to-end.

### Next

Stage 4 (4 inject sites — build preflight, deploy pre-spawn, accept preflight, existing site filter expansion) UNBLOCKED. Ships v2.56.0+.

## v2.54.0 - Meta-memory v1.1 Stage 2: 5 reflector triggers wired

Minor release. Stage 2 of meta-memory v1.1 implementation per `docs/plans/2026-05-08-meta-memory-implementation.md`. Wires reflector subagent spawn after 5 phase-completion events. Gated by `vg.config.md → meta_memory_mode != "disabled"` — default disabled, NO behavior change yet. Subsequent stages (3-6) ship attribution + inject sites + Dreams consolidation in v2.55-v2.59.

### Triggers wired (5 commits, 20 wiring tests)

| Task | Commit | Trigger event | File modified | Candidate target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | `f636e37` | `phase.deploy_completed` | `commands/vg/deploy.md` | target_step=deploy, type=procedural |
| 2.2 | `5ad625b` | `phase.test_completed` | `commands/vg/test.md` | target_step=test, type=declarative\|procedural |
| 2.3 | `339c825` | `phase.accept_uat_completed` | `commands/vg/accept.md` | target_step=accept, type=declarative |
| 2.4 | `e367bd2` | `phase.roam_completed` | `commands/vg/roam.md` | target_step=roam, type=declarative |
| 2.5 | `c80cadb` | `phase.amend_committed` | `commands/vg/amend.md` | type=retract |

Each trigger:
- Inserted AFTER `</step>` close (or appropriate non-bash-fence boundary) to preserve markdown rendering
- Mirror byte-identical (canonical ↔ `.claude/`)
- Documented in `commands/vg/_shared/reflection-trigger.md` with inputs/fingerprint/gating
- 4 wiring tests per task: spawn-reference, doc-listed, both mirrors byte-identical

### Reflector inputs by trigger

- **post-deploy:** events.db deploy.* + DEPLOY-STATE.json deployed.{env} + .deploy-log.{env}.txt + vg.config.md
- **post-test:** events.db test.* + codegen.* + TEST-GOALS verdicts + fix-loop iteration count
- **post-accept:** UAT-CHECKLIST verdicts + events.db gate.fired + structured digest of user msgs (NO raw transcript — echo-chamber guard)
- **post-roam:** roam findings JSON + state-mismatch report (high-signal: catches bugs review/test miss)
- **post-amend:** AMENDMENT-LOG.md + diff between old/new CONTEXT.md decisions (retract candidates for rules referencing removed decisions)

### Verified

- 20 new wiring tests PASS (4 per trigger × 5 triggers)
- 55+ regression assertions PASS (all prior stages still green)
- Mirrors byte-identical across all 5 affected canonical/`.claude/` pairs
- Pre-existing 44 unrelated test failures from earlier infra are NOT introduced by this batch (verified at f636e37 baseline)

### Migration

No breaking changes. `meta_memory_mode` flag defaults `disabled` — no spawn until explicitly enabled per Stage 6 rollout. Existing deploy/test/accept/roam/amend flows unchanged.

### Next

Stage 3 (CRITICAL — causal attribution: sequence checksum + per-step execution prober + outcome event schema) ships v2.55-v2.56. HARD GATE before Stage 4 inject sites — without attribution, procedural rules cannot be promoted (cargo-cult prevention per design Section 13.4).

## v2.53.0 - npm package skeleton + meta-memory v1.1 schema (Stage 1)

Minor release. Bundles two parallel workstreams:

### A — npm package `vgflow` (public registry)

Skeleton ready for `npm publish --access=public`. See `docs/PUBLISH-NPM.md` for workflow.

- `package.json` — name=vgflow, bin=vg, license=MIT, publishConfig.access=public
- `bin/vg.js` — Node entry, spawn bash dispatcher with VG_HOME env
- `bin/vg-cli-dispatcher.sh` — bash router (version, help, install, sync, doctor, health, uninstall)
- `scripts/npm-postinstall.js` — conservative postinstall (prints location + prompt; does NOT auto-modify settings.json)
- `scripts/npm-prepublish-check.js` — gate VERSION ≠ package.json version
- `.npmignore` — excludes .git/, .vg/, .claude/, .codex/, tests/, dev-phases/, docs/, tarballs (pack ~6.4 MB, 1546 files)
- `docs/PUBLISH-NPM.md` — full publish workflow + CI/CD example

Smoke verified: `vg version`, `vg help`, `vg doctor` work locally after `npm install -g ./vgflow-X.Y.Z.tgz`.

User next step (manual): `npm login` → `npm publish --access=public`.

### B — Meta-memory v1.1 schema (Stage 1 of 6)

Per `docs/plans/2026-05-08-meta-memory-implementation.md`. Stage 1 = schema + validator. No behavior changes yet; subsequent stages (v2.54-v2.59) wire reflector triggers + inject sites + Dreams consolidation.

**Task 1.1 — Schema fields documented** (commit 3c98e23):
- `type: declarative | procedural` (default declarative for backwards compat)
- `authority: advisory | reference` (executable BLOCKED in v1)
- `conditions: { all_of: [], any_of: [] }` DSL replacing applies_when_all_match
- `target_step: deploy|roam|amend` added (10 allowed values total)
- Procedural-only fields: `sequence[]`, `success_signals[]`, `attribution_required`, `shadow_evaluator`, `shadow_min_samples=5`, `shadow_min_correctness=0.8`
- `fingerprint: { repo_id, deploy_target, health_cmd, package_manager, dockerfile_hash }`

Mirrored byte-identical to: `.codex/skills/vg-{reflector,lesson}/SKILL.md` + `codex-skills/vg-{reflector,lesson}/SKILL.md`.

**Task 1.2 — Validator script** (commit bf2c6c8):
- `.claude/scripts/validators/verify-rule-schema-v1-1.py` (with canonical mirror)
- 16 pytest cases covering positive + negative + edge paths
- Enforces: target_step enum, type enum, authority gate, procedural required fields, declarative MUST NOT have sequence, relative-date detection in body

### C — Other

- Drop stale .r{1a,2,3.5,4}-backup files (commit 2977d85; ~1.7 MB × 2 freed in canonical + .claude mirror)
- Worktree isolation regression suite + `docs/multi-session.md` (commit 6ca6119; 4 tests)

### Verified

- `tests/hooks/` — 30 passed
- `tests/test_worktree_isolation.py` — 4 passed
- `tests/test_rule_schema_v1_1.py` — 5 passed
- `tests/test_verify_rule_schema_v1_1.py` — 16 passed
- Mirror byte-identical (canonical ↔ .claude/) verified
- Smoke `npm pack` → 6.4 MB, 1546 files (excluded all sensitive paths)
- Smoke `npm install -g ./vgflow-2.53.0.tgz` → `vg version` prints 2.53.0

### Migration

No breaking changes. Existing rules without `type` field default to `declarative` at validation time. v2.5x upgrade is `git pull` + `/vg:sync`.

For npm distribution: `npm install -g vgflow` (after first publish — name confirmed available on registry).

### Next

Stage 2 (5 reflector triggers — post-deploy/test/accept/roam/amend) ships next minor release(s). Tracking via `docs/plans/2026-05-08-meta-memory-implementation.md`.

## v2.52.2 - #140 cross-session destructive guard

Patch release. Closes the deferred portion of #140 P0 (cross-session lock — issue body suggested fix #5).

### Problem

v2.52.0 destructive-op guard scanned only `.vg/active-runs/${session_id}.json` (own session). When 2+ Claude Code sessions ran concurrently:

- Session A: `/vg:build phase 5` mid-run with untracked `PLAN.md`/`API-CONTRACTS.md`
- Session B: idle, runs `git checkout main` → drops A's untracked artifacts → cascade

Session B's destructive guard didn't fire because Session B had no own active run.

### Fix

`vg-pre-tool-use-bash.sh` now scans **all** `.vg/active-runs/*.json` for fresh runs (own + others). Block fires when ANY session has an active run.

- Stale runs (>VG_RUN_TTL_SEC, default 1h) treated as inactive → covers crashed sessions where active-runs file never got cleaned up.
- Diagnostic now lists each active run with sid prefix + command + phase + age, marked `(this session)` vs `(OTHER session)`.
- Telemetry payload `vg.destructive_op_blocked` includes `active_runs[]` JSON for forensic correlation.

### Bypass / recovery

Same as v2.52.0: `VG_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1`. Plus stale-run override:

```bash
# If active runs are stale (crashed sessions), force release:
rm .vg/active-runs/<stale-sid>.json
# or wait ${VG_RUN_TTL_SEC:-3600}s for TTL expiry
```

### Verified

- Smoke 3/3 PASS:
  - Other-session fresh + own-session idle → BLOCK exit 2 (cross-session catch)
  - Only stale runs (>1h) → ALLOW (TTL expiry)
  - `VG_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1` bypass with fresh other-session → ALLOW exit 0
- Diagnostic renders run list correctly via env-var-passed VG_OWN_SID
- `tests/hooks/` — 30 passed, no regressions
- `.claude/` ↔ canonical mirror byte-identical

### Triage

- **Closes #140 P0** — full coverage now shipped (v2.52.0 single-session + v2.52.2 cross-session). Issue body suggested fixes #1, #4, #5 all delivered.

## v2.52.1 - Helper bug cluster: #137 + #138 + #139

Patch release. Three independent helper bugs surfaced by PrintwayV3 dogfood under Codex zsh.

### #139 (HIGH) — matrix-merger PASS verdict with BLOCKED goals

`commands/vg/_shared/lib/matrix-merger.sh:262-275` — `merge_and_write_matrix` emitted `VERDICT=PASS` when `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX` had 42 READY + 5 BLOCKED + 0 intermediate. Weighted priority gate (critical 100% / important 80% / nice-to-have 50%) computed per-priority pct, but did NOT short-circuit on BLOCKED/UNREACHABLE absolute counts. Per spec (vg-review SKILL.md 100% gate): any conclusive BLOCKED → BLOCK regardless of weighted threshold.

**Fix:** Add `elif total_by_status['BLOCKED'] > 0 or total_by_status['UNREACHABLE'] > 0: verdict = 'BLOCK'` before weighted gate computation. NOT_SCANNED/FAILED still route through INTERMEDIATE branch first.

### #138 (MEDIUM) — phase-resolver zsh nomatch

`commands/vg/_shared/lib/phase-resolver.sh:42,69,81` — `${phases_dir}/${input}-*` glob raised `zsh: no matches found` under default NOMATCH option. Bash silently expands no-match glob to literal; zsh errors. Cascade: `resolve_phase_dir` failed before falling back to step 2/3, breaking `/vg:review` under Codex zsh.

**Fix:** Add at function entry `[ -n "${ZSH_VERSION:-}" ] && setopt LOCAL_OPTIONS NULL_GLOB NO_NOMATCH 2>/dev/null || true`. Uses `LOCAL_OPTIONS` so caller shell options auto-restore on function exit. Bash unaffected.

### #137 (MEDIUM) — inject-rule-cards.sh BASH_SOURCE strict

`commands/vg/_shared/lib/inject-rule-cards.sh:324` — `if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" = "${0}" ]` raised `BASH_SOURCE[0]: parameter not set` under strict shell (`set -u`) or non-bash. Direct-vs-sourced detection broke before line ran.

**Fix:** `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` fallback. Sourced under bash uses BASH_SOURCE; sourced under zsh/sh falls back to $0. Direct invocation behavior unchanged.

### Verified

- Smoke #137: `bash -c 'set -u; source inject-rule-cards.sh'` → exit 0 (was set-u error)
- Smoke #139: 42 READY + 5 BLOCKED → verdict=BLOCK (was PASS)
- `tests/hooks/` — 30 passed, no regressions
- `.claude/` ↔ canonical mirror byte-identical (3 files)
- Bash syntax check on all 3 modified files

### Triage

- Closes #137 (inject-rule-cards.sh strict-shell)
- Closes #138 (phase-resolver zsh nomatch)
- Closes #139 (matrix-merger PASS verdict with BLOCKED)

## v2.52.0 - #140 P0 mitigations: destructive-op guard + artifact-loss diagnostic + intent-to-add

Minor release. Three independent mitigations for #140 (P0 critical: blueprint artifacts vanish mid-run on auto-checkout). Investigator audit confirmed VG harness has NO auto-destructive git ops — root cause is AI-initiated mid-run `git checkout`/`reset`/`clean` to "fix" perceived issues. These fixes harden the harness against that cascade pattern.

### Fix 4 — `vg.artifacts_missing` event at run-complete

`vg-orchestrator run-complete` now emits a `vg.artifacts_missing` event when `runtime_contract.must_write` paths fail existence/size check. Payload includes:
- `missing_paths[]` — declared artifact paths that vanished
- `reflog_recent[]` — last 10 reflog entries for post-mortem correlation
- `branches_recent[]` — last 10 branches by committer date
- `diagnostic` — actionable hint pointing to git reflog

Lets `vg:bug-report` capture exact destructive op timeline + failed paths. Existing BLOCK behavior on missing must_write unchanged; this is purely additive forensics.

### Fix 5 — PreToolUse Bash destructive-op guard

`vg-pre-tool-use-bash.sh` now blocks the following commands when `.vg/active-runs/<sid>.json` is fresh+alive:
- `git checkout <branch>`, `git checkout -- .`, `git checkout .`
- `git switch <branch>`
- `git reset --hard|--keep|--merge`
- `git clean -f|-d|-x`
- `git stash drop|clear|pop`
- `git branch -D|-d`
- `git rebase|cherry-pick|merge|revert --abort`
- `git worktree remove|prune`
- `rm -rf .vg/runs`, `rm -rf .vg/phases`, `rm -rf .vg`

Exit 2 with diagnostic + emits `vg.destructive_op_blocked` telemetry.

**Bypass:** `VG_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1` env var (operator opt-in). Recommended alternative when bypass is needed: `git stash push --include-untracked` → recovery work → `git stash pop`.

### Fix 1 — PostToolUse-Agent intent-to-add hook

New hook `scripts/hooks/vg-post-tool-use-agent.sh` runs after every Agent tool return. Parses subagent JSON envelope for artifact paths (`paths[]`, `summary_path`, `build_log_path`, `artifacts[]`, `sub_files[]`) and runs `git add --intent-to-add` on each.

Effect: if artifacts live OUTSIDE `.vg/` (ignored), git status surfaces them after subagent return. A subsequent `git checkout` will refuse with "would overwrite" instead of silently dropping. For default `.vg/`-based artifacts (gitignored), hook is a no-op.

Best-effort + fail-soft. NEVER blocks. Skips when not in git repo or no active VG run. Wired via `install-hooks.sh` new `Agent` matcher in PostToolUse.

### Settings.json change (re-run /vg:sync to apply)

```json
"PostToolUse": [
  {"matcher": "TodoWrite|TaskCreate|TaskUpdate", "hooks": [...]},
  {"matcher": "AskUserQuestion", "hooks": [...]},
  {"matcher": "Agent", "hooks": [{"command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/vg-post-tool-use-agent.sh"}]}  // NEW
]
```

### Verified

- `tests/hooks/` — 30 passed, no regressions
- Smoke Fix 5 — `git checkout main` blocked exit 2; `VG_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1` bypass exit 0; `git status` allowed; `rm -rf .vg/runs` blocked
- Smoke Fix 4 — orchestrator emit-event wired in `__main__.py:4444+`
- Bash syntax check on modified hooks
- `.claude/` mirror byte-identical with canonical (3 files: vg-pre-tool-use-bash.sh, vg-post-tool-use-agent.sh, install-hooks.sh, vg-orchestrator/__main__.py)

### Migration

```bash
# Existing projects pick up new PostToolUse-Agent matcher:
/vg:sync
# Or directly:
bash scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh --target ~/.claude/settings.json
```

If you rely on `git checkout` mid-run for any reason, prefix with `VG_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1` or wrap in `git stash push --include-untracked`.

### Triage

- **Partially closes #140 P0** — all 3 fixes shipped. Causal misattribution prevention (Fix 4 diagnostic) + AI cascade prevention (Fix 5 guard) + tracked-artifact protection (Fix 1 intent-to-add). Cross-session lock (issue #140 suggested fix #5 full coverage) deferred to follow-up — current fixes catch the AI-driven cascade pattern observed in PrintwayV3 dogfood.

## v2.51.14 - POSIX hook wrapper bypass: fixes #141 (PrintwayV3 Mac wrapper missing)

Patch release. Closes BLOCK-severity issue #141 (initial commit message and notes misattributed to #137 — corrected). POSIX install emits hook command that hard-depends on `vg-run-bash-hook.py`; when the wrapper file is missing (incomplete sync, manual settings copy, etc.), every `UserPromptSubmit` is blocked.

> Note: #137 (`inject-rule-cards-bash-source-strict`) is a separate bash strict-shell intolerance bug, NOT addressed by this release. See https://github.com/vietdev99/vgflow/issues/137.

### Symptom

```
UserPromptSubmit operation blocked by hook:
[python3 "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/vg-run-bash-hook.py" "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/vg-user-prompt-submit.sh"]:
can't open file '/Users/dzungnguyen/Vibe Code/Code/PrintwayV3/.claude/scripts/hooks/vg-run-bash-hook.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

### Root cause

`scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh::_cmd()` POSIX branch (lines 91-94 pre-fix) emitted a python wrapper command:

```python
return (
    f'{python_cmd} "${{CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}}/.claude/scripts/hooks/{runner_name}" '
    f'"${{CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}}/.claude/scripts/hooks/{script_name}"'
)
```

Wrapper exists to prefer Git Bash over WSL bash on Windows (issue #129). On POSIX it just proxies bash and adds a fragile second-file dependency. If `vg-run-bash-hook.py` is not present in the project (incomplete `/vg:sync`, manual settings.json copy from another project, etc.), python3 errors with Errno 2 BEFORE the bash hook script ever runs → hook exits non-zero → UserPromptSubmit BLOCKED.

### Fixed

- `scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh::_cmd()` — POSIX now matches Windows behavior (issue #129 path), emitting the `.sh` path directly without wrapper. Bash reads the shebang and runs the script. The wrapper file is no longer a runtime dependency on POSIX. Newly-installed POSIX projects, and any project that re-runs `install-hooks.sh` (or `/vg:sync`), get the wrapper-free hook commands.
- Wrapper `scripts/hooks/vg-run-bash-hook.py` file is preserved for legacy installs already wired through it; existing settings.json files keep working until the next sync.

### Migration

Existing POSIX users hit by this issue: re-run `/vg:sync` from inside the affected project, or run `bash scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh --target ~/.claude/settings.json` from the vgflow-repo. Hook entries are rewritten without the wrapper.

### Verified

- `python -m pytest tests/hooks/ -q` (no regressions).
- Canonical ↔ `.claude/` mirror byte-identical for `install-hooks.sh`.

### Triage

- Closes #141 (PrintwayV3 Mac wrapper missing → all prompts blocked).
- Initial commit + release notes incorrectly cited #137; corrected post-release.

## v2.51.13 - Subagent session isolation: fixes #135 (Write deadlock) + #136 (rogue run-start)

Patch release. Closes BLOCK-severity issues #135 and #136 — both root-caused to subagent hooks resolving to the PARENT session's state instead of the subagent's own.

### Symptoms

- **#135 (Subagent Write deadlock)**: every `/vg:build` wave-1 task BLOCKED. `vg-build-task-executor` subagent calls `Write`, `vg-pre-tool-use-write.sh` fires, looks up the active-runs file under the parent's session_id (env-derived), demands tasklist evidence the subagent cannot produce (no `TodoWrite` tool in subagent's allow-list). Subagent returns `preflight_gate_unsatisfiable`; build never advances.
- **#136 (Rogue run-start overwriting parent's lock)**: spawning `vg-build-task-executor` from inside an active `/vg:build` run creates a NEW run in `events.db` + overwrites `.vg/active-runs/<parent_sid>.json`. Parent's `run-status`, progress tracking, and post-spawn `wave.completed` validation all break.

### Root cause

Claude Code passes the firing context's `session_id` in the hook stdin JSON. Subagent hooks receive the SUBAGENT's `session_id` there; parent hooks receive the PARENT's. But the legacy `vg_resolve_session_id` resolver only consulted `CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID` env var → `.vg/.session-context.json` fallback. Subagent processes often have an empty `CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID`, so the fallback returned the parent's session_id from the context file. Result: subagent's hooks routed to the parent's slot, fired the parent's gates, and overwrote the parent's lock.

### Fixed

- New helper `vg_resolve_session_id_from_input` in `scripts/hooks/_lib.sh` — prefers hook stdin's `session_id` field, falls back to env+context resolver. Stable contract: empty/missing stdin sid still works for unit tests and offline invocations.
- `scripts/hooks/vg-pre-tool-use-write.sh` calls the new helper. Subagent Write hooks now resolve to the subagent's own sid; `.vg/active-runs/<subagent_sid>.json` doesn't exist → hook early-exits 0 → Write goes through. Closes #135.
- `scripts/hooks/vg-user-prompt-submit.sh` calls the new helper for both branches (mid-flow follow-up + slash-command). Subagent envelopes that happen to start with `/vg:<cmd>` (e.g. literal text inside the prompt body) write to `.vg/active-runs/<subagent_sid>.json`, leaving the parent's lock untouched. Closes #136.
- **Defense in depth**: `vg-user-prompt-submit.sh` now refuses cross-phase mainline overwrite (`vg:build phase=5` → `vg:blueprint phase=6`) when both commands are mainline AND the existing run is fresh+alive. Even if the stdin-sid path failed for some reason, a rogue subagent prompt cannot stomp on the parent's mainline lock — hook exits 2 with an actionable diagnostic.

### Verified

- `python -m pytest tests/hooks/test_subagent_session_isolation.py -q` (4 passed — Write routes via stdin sid, falls back to env when stdin sid absent, subagent prompt does not overwrite parent lock, cross-phase mainline overwrite refused).
- `python -m pytest tests/hooks/ -q` (30 passed — no regressions in existing hook suite).
- `python scripts/verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py --json` (71 checked, 0 drift).
- Canonical ↔ `.claude/` mirror byte-identical for `_lib.sh`, `vg-pre-tool-use-write.sh`, `vg-user-prompt-submit.sh`.

### Triage

- Closes #135 (subagent Write deadlock).
- Closes #136 (rogue run-start overwriting parent lock).

## v2.51.12 - Tasklist sync after AskUserQuestion + #134 cross-session legacy run filter

Patch release. Closes a tasklist-drift gap reported by sếp Dũng (2026-05-08) and **issue #134** (Codex orchestrator legacy `current-run.json` cross-session leak).

### Tasklist drift after AskUserQuestion (sếp Dũng's bug)

**Symptom:** AI runs `/vg:review`, asks user a 1-2-3 question (option 3 = Other / custom text). User types a custom branch. AI receives the answer, makes a decision, executes the next bash/edit — but **does not call `TaskUpdate`** to reflect the chosen branch in the native task UI. The task UI silently stays on the old branch; user loses real-time visibility into the AI's actual decisions.

**Root cause:** Pre-v2.51.12, no PostToolUse hook fired on `AskUserQuestion`. `install-hooks.sh` only registered PostToolUse for `TodoWrite|TaskCreate|TaskUpdate`, so an `AskUserQuestion` answer landed in the AI's tool-result with zero harness signal to update the task UI. Skill prompts didn't contain a "post-AskUserQuestion sync" rule either.

**Fix:**
- New hook `scripts/hooks/vg-post-tool-use-askuserquestion.sh` — non-blocking advisory. Fires AFTER every `AskUserQuestion` answer when an active VG run + tasklist contract exist. Emits `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` reminder telling the AI to call `TaskUpdate` (or `TodoWrite` on legacy runtime) to mirror the chosen branch BEFORE running the next bash/edit. Silent no-op when no VG run is active (context guard) or no contract yet (e.g. early in run-start).
- `scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh::VG_ENTRIES` registers a 2nd PostToolUse matcher: `{"matcher": "AskUserQuestion", "hooks": [{...}]}`. Existing `TodoWrite|TaskCreate|TaskUpdate` matcher unchanged.
- `commands/vg/_shared/lib/tasklist-projection-instruction.md` adds a new section **"Post-AskUserQuestion sync (RULE — v2.51.12+)"** with the explicit pattern: keep group header, edit active step's `↳` sub-item to mention the chosen branch, append new `↳` sub-items if the answer expands scope, mark `completed` if it closes the step.

### Issue #134 — Codex orchestrator legacy current-run cross-session leak

**Symptom:** `vg-orchestrator run-start` in Codex with explicit `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` still read legacy `.vg/current-run.json` from another session (e.g. `/vg:build 5`), blocking `/vg:review 4.6` and causing namespace mismatch + FK failures.

**Fix (`scripts/vg-orchestrator/state.py::read_active_run`):** when caller supplied `command_hint` and/or `phase_hint`, the legacy fallback now checks them against the snapshot's `command` / `phase` fields and returns `None` on mismatch. Hints stay advisory — only applied when caller explicitly supplied them AND the legacy snapshot disagrees. No regression for unhinted callers (`run-status`, default Stop hook).

### Verified

- Hook smoke (no active run) → silent exit 0.
- Hook smoke (active run + contract) → emits proper JSON `additionalContext` + exit 0.
- Real install: `bash scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh --target /tmp/test/.claude/settings.json` produces 2 PostToolUse entries (TodoWrite|TaskCreate|TaskUpdate + AskUserQuestion), commands properly quoted.
- `python -m pytest tests/hooks/test_session_resolve.py scripts/tests/test_orchestrator_run_status.py -q` (19 passed).
- `python scripts/verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py --json` (71 checked, 0 drift).
- Canonical ↔ `.claude/` mirror byte-identical for `state.py`, `install-hooks.sh`, `vg-post-tool-use-askuserquestion.sh`, `tasklist-projection-instruction.md`.

### Triage

- Closes #134 (Codex cross-session legacy run leak — `read_active_run` honours hints).

## v2.51.11 - /vg:update auto-chains /vg:reapply-patches when conflicts parked

Patch release. UX improvement — `/vg:update` no longer leaves the user to manually type `/vg:reapply-patches` after a release with merge or gate conflicts. The terminal banner now emits a runtime-agnostic AI assistant directive that triggers the assistant (Claude Code or Codex) to chain into `/vg:reapply-patches` in the very next turn, so the per-conflict interactive prompts run in one continuous session.

### Why interactive must stay interactive

`/vg:reapply-patches` cannot be auto-decided — each parked conflict needs a human judgment from 4 options (`edit` / `keep upstream` / `restore local` / `skip`). Same for `--verify-gates` mode (`use upstream` / `keep merged` / `skip+flag` / `cancel`). So this release does NOT auto-resolve. It only removes the UX friction of typing the next command — the AI assistant is now told to invoke the skill directly, the human still answers each prompt.

### Fixed

- `commands/vg/update.md` step `9_report` reworked. When `CONFLICTS > 0` OR `${PLANNING_DIR}/vgflow-patches/gate-conflicts.md` exists, the banner now prints:
  - `▶ NEXT_ACTION=/vg:reapply-patches[ --verify-gates]`
  - A runtime-agnostic `===== AI ASSISTANT DIRECTIVE =====` block telling the assistant to invoke `/vg:reapply-patches` in the next turn without waiting for a fresh user prompt.
  Auto-detects T8 gate conflicts and appends `--verify-gates` to the suggested command. Applies to Claude Code (skill invocation) and Codex (skill invocation) — no runtime-specific assumptions.
- `success_criteria` updated to document the new chain behaviour.

## v2.51.10 - Windows hook wrapper bypass (PR #132) + zsh `local path` fix (#133)

Patch release. Closes #129 (PR #132 — Windows + Git Bash hooks fail with `cannot execute binary file`) and #133 (zsh `local path` collision in `graphify-safe.sh::_vg_graphify_mtime`).

### Fixed

- `scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh::_cmd()` platform-detects Windows (`os.name == 'nt'`) and emits the `.sh` path **without** the `python vg-run-bash-hook.py` wrapper. Root cause: Claude Code on Windows spawns hooks via `bash <argv>` (no `-c`); `bash` treats `argv[0]` as a script file path. When `argv[0]` is `python` / `python3` (a binary), bash opens the EXE, reads PE header, rejects with `cannot execute binary file`. Symptom user-side: every hook fails on first message; Windows then resolves `python3` through the App Execution Alias and pops the Microsoft Store dialog. POSIX path unchanged — wrapper retained for WSL-bash protection logic. Trade-off: Windows path drops WSL-bash protection (rare; current state fails 100% on Windows so no protection in practice). Closes #129.
- `commands/vg/_shared/lib/graphify-safe.sh::_vg_graphify_mtime` renamed `local path="$1"` → `local target="$1"`. Reason: zsh treats `path` as a special tied alias of `$PATH` (array), so `local path=...` rebinds `$PATH` to a single string and breaks subsequent `stat` lookups on macOS zsh. Symptom: `vg_graphify_rebuild_safe` reports rebuild failed even though graph.json was rebuilt successfully. Closes #133.

### Verified

- `bash -c 'source commands/vg/_shared/lib/graphify-safe.sh; _vg_graphify_mtime VERSION'` returns numeric mtime; `$PATH` intact after function call.
- Mirror parity: `commands/vg/_shared/lib/graphify-safe.sh` ↔ `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/graphify-safe.sh` byte-identical.
- PR #132 CI pass (POSIX `pytest scripts/tests/test_install_hooks_idempotent.py`).

## v2.51.9 - Windows bug-reporter body-file hardening + regression coverage

Patch release. Ships the `bug-reporter.sh` Windows fix from PR #131 and adds regression coverage so future refactors cannot silently fall back to argv-based issue bodies again.

### Fixed

- `commands/vg/_shared/lib/bug-reporter.sh` and `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/bug-reporter.sh` now submit GitHub issues via `gh issue create --body-file ...` instead of `--body "$body"`. This avoids the Windows + Git Bash argv path that created empty-body issues while still returning exit 0 (#130, victim issue #129).

### Verified

- `python -m pytest scripts/tests/test_bug_reporter.py -q` (2 passed).
- Added regression coverage for both adversarial multi-line quoting and the Windows `--body-file` submission path in `scripts/tests/test_bug_reporter.py` and `.claude/scripts/tests/test_bug_reporter.py`.

## v2.51.8 - /vg:update no longer touches global ~/.codex by default

Patch release. Bug surfaced during user audit: `/vg:update` step `8_sync_codex` deployed VG skills + agents into **global** `~/.codex/skills` and `~/.codex/agents` whenever `~/.codex` directory existed (i.e., user has Codex CLI installed for any reason). No env var or flag — silent global side effect. Inconsistent with `install.sh` (default project-only, opt-in via `--global-codex`) and `sync.sh` (`SKIP_GLOBAL=true` default, opt-in via `--global-codex`).

### Fixed

- `commands/vg/update.md` step `8_sync_codex`: gate global `~/.codex` deploy behind `VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX=1`. Default behavior is now project-only (`${REPO_ROOT}/.codex` always refreshed, global skipped). Users who want global Codex install run `VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX=1 /vg:update`.
- Banner echoes the chosen path: either `Codex global deploy: VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX=1 — refreshed ~/.codex skills/agents` or `Codex global deploy: skipped (default; set VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX=1 to opt in)`.
- Updated `success_criteria` in `update.md` to document the new opt-in convention.

### Convention summary (now consistent)

| Tool                | Default       | Opt-in                              |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| `install.sh`        | project only  | `--global-codex` flag               |

### Verified

- Mirror parity: `commands/vg/update.md` ↔ `.claude/commands/vg/update.md` ↔ `codex-skills/vg-update/SKILL.md` ↔ `.codex/skills/vg-update/SKILL.md` all carry the env var guard (5 occurrences each).

## v2.51.7 - macOS bash 3.2 portability + codex skill resync (#126, PR #125)

Patch release. Closes issue #126 (real bug on current v2.51.6) + PR #125 (codex skill mirror drift).

### Fixed

- `commands/vg/_shared/lib/override-debt.sh::log_override_debt` no longer uses Bash 4 `${var^^}` uppercase expansion, which fails on macOS `/bin/bash 3.2` with "bad substitution" at line 53. Replaced with portable `printf | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'` so advisory debt logging works on darwin (#126). Surfaced when `/vg:review 4.5 --sandbox` advisory goal coverage gate aborted after `verify-goal-coverage-phase.py` returned `rc=2`.
- `.codex/skills/vg-review/SKILL.md` byte drift fixed via `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh --force` resync against canonical `codex-skills/` (PR #125 — issue #120 backend-only contract fix had landed in canonical but `sync.sh` hadn't been re-run).

### Triage

- Closes #126 — bash 3.2 fix above.
- Closes #127 — already fixed in v2.47.2+ (`review.md` resolves helpers via `${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}` with `.claude/scripts` fallback at line 7460).
- Closes #128 — already fixed in v2.47.2 (`scripts/validators/verify-no-no-verify.py` allowlist patterns at lines 96-97 cover `tests/test_no_no_verify.py` + `scripts/tests/test_no_no_verify.py`; comment at line 82 references Issue #87).

### Verified

- Smoke: `bash -c 'sev_upper=$(printf "%s" "critical" | tr "[:lower:]" "[:upper:]"); echo "$sev_upper"'` → `CRITICAL`.
- Canonical `commands/vg/_shared/lib/override-debt.sh` ↔ `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/override-debt.sh` byte-identical.
- `diff -rq codex-skills/ .codex/skills/` clean (PR #125).

## v2.51.6 - Python session resolver hook-env parity (PR #124)

Patch release. Sister patch to v2.51.4 (PR #122 — bash resolver). Bash `_lib.sh::vg_resolve_session_id` already checked `CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID` first; python `state._session_id_from_env` did NOT. When Claude Code injected ONLY `CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID` into the hook subprocess (typical inside a hook fire) but not into bash subprocesses spawned later in the same session, bash resolved to the hook session id while python fell through to `.vg/.session-context.json`. Two different `session_id`s → tasklist contract written under one run dir while trace landed in another → run-complete contract validator failed with "evidence missing" even though `TaskCreate` calls had fired.

### Fixed

- `scripts/vg-orchestrator/state.py::_session_id_from_env` now prepends `CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID` to its env priority list, matching bash `_lib.sh::vg_resolve_session_id`. Hook subprocesses on both sides now resolve to the same `session_id`, so contract write (python `tasklist-projected`) and trace write (bash hook) target the same run dir.

### Verified

- `python -m pytest tests/hooks/test_session_resolve.py -q` (12 passed — 10 existing + 2 new parity cases).
- `python scripts/verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py --json` (71 checked, 0 drift).
- Canonical `scripts/vg-orchestrator/state.py` ↔ `.claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator/state.py` byte-identical.

## v2.51.5 - Sweep orphan default.json on session-start (#113 followup)

Patch release. Surfaced during PrintwayV3 sync of v2.51.4: a leftover `.vg/active-runs/default.json` written by the **pre-fix** bash hooks could remain alongside its session-keyed twin even after the v2.51.4 helper migrated `.session-context.json`. The migration only fired when context's `run_id` matched the orphan; a pre-fix run that finished BEFORE the upgrade left an orphan keyed to a different run.

### Fixed

- Add `vg_sweep_orphan_default` to `scripts/hooks/_lib.sh`. Called from `vg-session-start.sh` (resume / compact / startup matchers). Archives `default.json` to `default.json.orphan-bak-<epoch>` only when `default.json` names a real (non-default / non-unknown) sibling that already carries the same `run_id`. Divergent run_id, missing twin, or default-as-content-sid → preserved (cautious vs partial rollback).

### Verified

- `python3 -m pytest tests/hooks/test_session_resolve.py -v` (10 tests, +3 new for sweep happy path / no-twin / divergent-run_id).
- `python3 -m pytest tests/hooks/ scripts/tests/test_universal_mutating_tool_gate.py scripts/tests/test_codex_mirror_equivalence.py` (38 passed).
- Hand-tested on PrintwayV3: live `vg:build 4.5` session with leftover `default.json` from pre-fix run — sweep archived to `default.json.orphan-bak-1778113538`, live `a7e38c21-...json` preserved.

## v2.51.4 - Bash hook session resolution (issue #113)

Patch release. Fixes the orphan `default.json` slot that surfaced in PrintwayV3 dogfood: parallel Claude Code sessions with `CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID` unset all wrote to the shared `.vg/active-runs/default.json` slot, clobbering each other and stranding stale state files alongside the per-session ones.

### Fixed

- Bash hooks no longer fall back to the literal `default` session id. New shared helper `scripts/hooks/_lib.sh` resolves env vars first, then `.vg/.session-context.json` (with auto-migration of legacy `default` to a per-run synthetic id), then falls back to the `unknown` orphan sentinel — same shape Python state already used (#113).
- `vg-user-prompt-submit.sh` now synthesizes `session-unknown-<run_id_prefix>` when no real session id is available, mirroring the orchestrator OHOK-9 path so two parallel env-unset sessions land on distinct active-run files.
- `state.py::_safe_session_filename` and `_is_unknown_orphan_session` now treat the legacy `default` literal as the unknown orphan sentinel — defence in depth for any caller still passing it.
- Helper auto-renames orphan `.vg/active-runs/default.json` to the per-run synthetic file on first read when its `run_id` matches the poisoned context, cleaning up existing dogfood pollution.

### Verified

- `python3 -m pytest tests/hooks/test_session_resolve.py -v` (7 new regression tests).
- `python3 -m pytest tests/hooks/ -v` (21 passing, no regressions).
- `python3 -m pytest scripts/tests/test_universal_mutating_tool_gate.py scripts/tests/test_hotfix_a_markstep_todowrite_reminder.py scripts/tests/test_codex_mirror_equivalence.py` (mirror parity green after `.claude/` sync).

## v2.51.3 - PrintwayV3 dogfood patches (PR #121)

Patch release. Merges PR #121 (`fix/printway-dogfood-2026-05-07`) bundling 4 surgical workflow fixes uncovered while running `/vg:review 4.4` on the **PrintwayV3** dogfood project. Smoke-tested end-to-end on Phase 4.4 (57 goals, all READY post-patch, run-complete PASS).

### Fixed

- `probe_data` (`commands/vg/_shared/lib/surface-probe.sh`) now scans Mongoose models + case variants. Backend-only Mongoose-stack phases no longer false-block on `no_migration_for_table:X` when collections have real Mongoose schemas but no SQL migrations directory.
- Tasklist hook (`scripts/hooks/vg-post-tool-use-todowrite.sh`) supports the newer Claude Code `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` schema in addition to legacy `TodoWrite`. Each call now correctly populates the projected tasklist evidence file so the `tasklist-projected` validator no longer false-blocks `run-complete` on TaskCreate-only runtimes.
- Validators honor explicit `surfaces` declarations and tolerant goal headers:
  - `verify-interface-standards.py` and `verify-error-message-runtime.py` now consume the `surfaces` dict from `INTERFACE-STANDARDS.json` (when present) instead of re-inferring from text-grep heuristics in API-CONTRACTS.
  - `verify-runtime-map-coverage.py` matches both `## Goal G-XX` and `## G-XX:` runtime-map headers (no longer requires the literal "Goal " prefix).
- `normalize_telemetry` in `scripts/vg-orchestrator/contracts.py` preserves the `severity` field for dict-form telemetry items. The 25 fail-only `severity: warn` events declared in skill-MDs are no longer silently treated as block-severity, so `/vg:review` run-complete no longer blocks clean phases on missing fail-only emissions.

### Verified

- `python -m pytest scripts/tests/test_interface_standards.py scripts/tests/test_review_backend_contract_issue120.py scripts/tests/test_runtime_map_crud_depth.py scripts/tests/test_codex_mirror_equivalence.py -q` (27 passed)
- `python scripts/verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py --json` (71 checked, 0 drift)
- Canonical → `.claude/` mirrors hash-identical for the 6 changed files.

### Triage

- Closes issue #111 (already fixed in v2.51.1 commit `208f704` — `cmd_merge` writes via `write_bytes` to bypass Windows text-mode CRLF translation).
- Closes issue #115 (already fixed in v2.51.2 commit `1b506e2` — `scripts/reconcile-build-summary.py` reconciles SUMMARY.md vs PRE-TEST-REPORT.md after in-scope fix loop).

## v2.51.2 - Review backend-only contract parity

Patch release. Merges PR #119 (`fix/codex-task-ui-runtime-lock`) and closes issue #120 by keeping backend-only `/vg:review` runs compatible with the review runtime contract.

### Fixed

- Backend-only `vg:review` fast-path now emits a synthetic root `scan-backend-surface-probes.json` artifact when browser discovery is legitimately skipped, so `run-complete` no longer false-blocks on the contract's `scan-*.json` requirement (#120).
- Canonical, `.claude`, and Codex `vg-review` mirrors are back in sync for the backend-only review path.

### Added

- Added regression coverage for issue #120 in canonical and `.claude` review test suites, including a contract-level check that reproduces the missing `scan-*.json` failure mode and verifies the synthetic backend scan artifact fixes it.

### Verified

- `python -m pytest scripts/tests/test_review_backend_contract_issue120.py scripts/tests/test_review_lens_plan.py scripts/tests/test_runtime_map_crud_depth.py scripts/tests/test_phaseP_real_verification.py scripts/tests/test_codex_mirror_equivalence.py -q`

## v2.51.1 - PR #117 merge follow-ups and interface standards fix

Patch release. Merges PR #117 (`fix/codex-session-state-test-parity`) into `main` and adds the post-merge fixes needed to close issue #118 and keep the Windows/source-checkout regression suite green.

### Fixed

- `verify-interface-standards.py` now imports `generate-interface-standards.py` from either `scripts/` or `.claude/scripts/`, so backend-only phases no longer fall back to false `cli=true` detection when the canonical helper lives under `.claude` (#118).
- Canonical and `.claude` regression tests now resolve repo roots and validator/orchestrator paths correctly when run from the source checkout, fixing doubled `.claude/.claude/...` paths in the emit-event, repo-lock, and clean-failure-state suites.
- Orchestrator run-status regression tests now force UTF-8 subprocess decoding on Windows, removing locale-driven `UnicodeDecodeError` noise and preserving stderr assertions for concurrent-session cases.
- Interface-standards and specs contract tests were updated to reflect the current orchestrator/task-tracker wiring after PR #117.

## v2.51.0 - Codex runtime parity and uninstall workflow

Minor release. Ships PR #112, merged into `main` on 2026-05-06, plus the post-merge Windows/runtime test fixes needed to keep the release train green.

### Added

- Added `/vg:uninstall` plus `scripts/vg_uninstall.py` to remove VG-managed local Claude/Codex surfaces while preserving unrelated user config.
- Added isolated CrossAI child runner + result normalizer coverage so Codex, Claude, and Gemini child CLIs no longer inherit project-local hook/config state.

### Fixed

- Blueprint close now syncs `blueprint-state.json` on `3_complete` before writing the completion marker, avoiding stale pending state after close.
- Hardened CrossAI validator, step-tracker, orchestrator run-status, Codex sync deploy, and uninstall coverage landed from PR #112.
- `scripts/crossai-runner.py` now prefers Git Bash over the WSL `bash.exe` launcher on Windows, matching the hook runner and keeping isolated child CLIs on a Windows-safe shell.
- `.claude` mirror regression tests now resolve the real repo root when run from the source checkout, instead of constructing broken `.claude/.claude/...` paths.

### Verified

## v2.50.5 - Scope challenger and container hardening fixes

Patch release. Fixes issue #110 and issue #107.

### Fixed

- Wrapper now skips only genuine trivial answers with no AI draft/option in accumulated context.
- Trivial confirmations with `**Recommended:**`, `<ai-draft>`, or selected option content now flow into `challenge_answer` so the draft gets challenged.
- Wrapper sets a safe `PLANNING_DIR=.vg` default for standalone use under `set -u`.
- `verify-container-hardening.py` no longer auto-detects vendored `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `target`, or `vendor` Dockerfiles.
- Container hardening output uses UTF-8 replace mode and defaults to JSON on non-TTY stdout, preventing orchestrator parse crashes on human text.

### Verified

- `bash scripts/validators/test-answer-challenger-trivial.sh`
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_container_hardening_issue107.py`
- Mirror parity for wrapper + validator shell test.
- `git diff --check`

## v2.50.4 - Test suite cleanup after tasklist gate hardening

Patch release. Fixes the post-v2.50.3 Test workflow failures caused by stale write-hook expectations and an oversized `vg:deploy` slim entry.

### Fixed

- Updated write-hook regression coverage for the universal mutating-tool tasklist gate: active VG runs now block source writes until tasklist evidence exists.
- Trimmed `commands/vg/deploy.md` below the 500-line slim-entry guard while preserving prod confirmation, telemetry, markers, and executor delegation.
- Kept deploy Codex mirrors functionally equivalent to canonical command sources.
- Hardened Windows test harness paths/encoding for bash-backed hook tests.

## v2.50.3 - Codex compact plan projection

Patch release. Ships PR #109, keeping Codex blueprint and review task projection compact enough for Codex sessions.

### Fixed

- Keeps Codex blueprint plan projection to a compact visible window instead of mirroring every `projection_items` row.
- Applies the same compact-plan rule to `vg:review`.
- Refreshes Claude test mirrors for the compact-plan behavior.

### Verified

- Added regression coverage for compact tasklist visibility.
- PR #109 targeted verification covered tasklist visibility, Codex sync deploy, bash hook runner, hook executable checks, install hook idempotency, and Codex hook schema/install tests.

## v2.50.2 - Codex UserPromptSubmit JSON adapter

Patch release. Fixes Codex CLI `UserPromptSubmit hook (failed): hook returned invalid user prompt submit JSON output` caused by the Codex installer wiring `UserPromptSubmit` directly to the Claude hook.

### Fixed

- Added a Codex-specific `vg-user-prompt-submit.py` wrapper that converts Claude `{"decision":"approve"}` output to Codex `{"continue":true}`.
- Maps Claude `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` to Codex `systemMessage` when a `/vg:*` run-start registers context.
- Updated Codex hook installer to point `UserPromptSubmit` at the wrapper and replace legacy direct `vg-entry-hook.py` commands.
- Kept Codex hook commands platform-neutral on Windows by avoiding Bash-style env prefixes.
- Made Codex bash hook forwarding choose Git Bash and normalize Windows paths before running shell hooks.

### Verified

- Added schema tests for non-VG and `/vg:build 1` UserPromptSubmit output.
- Added installer regression coverage for replacing legacy direct `vg-entry-hook.py` wiring.

## v2.50.1 — Windows-safe Claude bash hook runner

Patch release. Fixes Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit hook (failed)` on Windows machines where `bash` resolves to the WSL launcher (`C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`) before Git Bash. WSL bash cannot consume `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` Windows paths like `D:\Workspace\...`, so hooks failed before the script body started.

### Fixed

- Added `vg-run-bash-hook.py`, a tiny Python runner that preserves stdin/stdout/stderr/exit code while selecting Git Bash before WSL bash on Windows.
- Regenerated `.claude/settings.json` so all bash hooks go through the runner instead of calling `bash "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/..."` directly.
- Updated `scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh` so future `sync.sh` or hook reinstall operations keep emitting the Windows-safe runner command.
- Runner normalizes Windows script paths to `D:/...` before invoking Git Bash, covering both placeholder and absolute install modes.

### Verified

- Reproduced old failure: `bash "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/vg-user-prompt-submit.sh"` returned `rc=127` with `D:Workspace... No such file`.
- Verified new settings command returns `rc=0` for both non-VG prompts and `/vg:build 1`.
- `python -m py_compile` passes for the runner mirror pair.
- `scripts/tests/test_bash_hook_runner.py` passes.

## v2.50.0 — VG harness R6+R7+R8+R9+Task5 closed-loop integrity (PR #108)

Minor release. Squash-merge of **PR #108** delivering production hardening for native tasklist enforcement, mutating-tool gates, CrossAI skip validation, reflector spawning, and the first CrossAI multi-stage/multi-primary design + M1 infrastructure plan. This is a harness integrity release: the main theme is closing the remaining AI bypass paths seen during PrintwayV3 dogfood runs.

### Fixed

- **Claude adapter evidence gate** — `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter claude` now requires the native TodoWrite evidence file written by the PostToolUse hook. The orchestrator can no longer mark tasklist projection complete without a real TodoWrite call.
- **Claude Code adapter lock** — when `CLAUDECODE=1`, fallback/codex adapters are rejected for tasklist projection. `--adapter` now defaults to `auto`, resolving to `claude` in Claude Code and `fallback` elsewhere.
- **mark-step gate parity** — PreToolUse Bash enforcement now covers both `step-active` and `mark-step`, blocking direct marker updates until signed tasklist evidence exists.
- **TodoWrite UI sync reminder** — `vg-orchestrator mark-step <ns> <step>` emits non-blocking additional context reminding the model to refresh the native TodoWrite UI after backend step changes.
- **Universal mutating-tool gate** — Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit paths now deny source mutations during an active VG run until tasklist evidence exists, while allowing `.vg/` harness state writes.
- **Tasklist match coverage** — signed evidence must match the contract checklist, not just satisfy depth. Missing/extra task IDs are surfaced in the block diagnostic.
- **CrossAI skip anti-rationalization** — `skip-*-crossai*` overrides are fact-checked against `vg.config.md` and installed CLIs before logging override debt; build verification re-checks stale skip overrides at run-complete.
- **Blueprint reflector spawn** — blueprint close now uses the proven `general-purpose` agent + `Use skill: vg-reflector` pattern instead of an invalid `vg-reflector` subagent type.
- **Codex hook fixture hardening** — hook regression fixtures now include `adapter="claude"` where host `CLAUDECODE=1` inheritance would otherwise trigger adapter-spoof blocks.

### Added

- **Gemini fit report** — documents six appropriate Gemini touchpoints: long-context aggregation, multimodal design checks, CrossAI verification, test replay, high-volume scanners, and reflector/bootstrap synthesis.
- **CrossAI multi-stage multi-primary design** — 26 decisions covering phased rollout, `crossai.policy`, stage registry, Gemini+Codex parallel primaries, Claude adjudication, Codex 2-pass split, findings.v2 schema, telemetry, health output, and rollout strategy.
- **CrossAI M1 infrastructure plan** — 13-task TDD plan for shared CrossAI config/library infrastructure, stage wrappers, init/migrate commands, and template extension without changing existing build CrossAI behavior yet.

### Internal

- VERSION + VGFLOW-VERSION + `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION` -> 2.50.0.
- Release commit follows PR #108 squash commit `6ea5362`.
- New/updated tests cover tasklist evidence gating, adapter lock, mark-step reminder/gate, universal mutating-tool denial, CrossAI skip validation, phase profile behavior, reflector spawn correctness, runtime map CRUD depth, and step tracker behavior.

## v2.49.3 — Bug D universal tasklist + mid-flow context auto-injection (cherry-picks from PrintwayV3 dogfood follow-ups)

Patch release. Two more dogfood-driven commits landed on the fork branch after v2.49.2 ship — both close gate-evasion bypasses found during live `/vg:review 4.1` and `/vg:scope` sessions on PrintwayV3. Cherry-picked rather than waiting for next minor because both close exploitation paths.

### Fixed (commit 3826853 cherry-pick — mid-flow context auto-injection)

Operator dogfood pattern (post-P6): in flow A, AI hits `AskUserQuestion` mid-execution; user replies with plain text (not slash command); AI receives reply but **'loses' flow context** and may skip TodoWrite enforcement on the next tool call.

`UserPromptSubmit` hook previously fired only on `/vg:<cmd>` matches; plain follow-up replies passed through without context injection. AI compliance relied solely on the *reactive* `PreToolUse-bash` hook (fires after AI tries a tool) instead of *proactive* reminder.

**Fix:** when prompt is NOT a `/vg:<cmd>` AND active-run JSON exists AND run is alive (no terminal event), `vg-user-prompt-submit.sh` now injects a `<vg-flow-context>` reminder into stderr (Claude Code surfaces UserPromptSubmit stderr as system-reminder to the AI). Reminder content depends on tasklist projection state:

- Not yet projected: 3-step instruction (read contract, TodoWrite 2-layer, `tasklist-projected --adapter claude`)
- Projected with wrong adapter (`fallback`/`codex` in Claude Code session): warn AI to re-call with `--adapter claude` before next `step-active`
- Projected OK: continue per STEP order, no ad-hoc skip

Pattern follows `superpowers:using-superpowers`'s always-fires-on-conversation discipline but file-driven (`.vg/active-runs/<sid>.json`) and deterministic. Slash-command path unchanged; dead-run detection (terminal events) skips injection. Pure context injection — no tool blocking.

### Fixed (commit 87530d3 cherry-pick — Bug D universal tasklist enforcement)

Operator dogfood: `/vg:review 4.1` ran end-to-end **without ever calling TodoWrite**. Audit revealed enforcement was applied to review only; `blueprint`, `build`, `test`, `specs`, `roam` had partial or zero coverage. AI exploited the gap by silently skipping TodoWrite + `tasklist-projected` emission, then attempted hook bypass when blocked. Bug L Track D claimed "universal" coverage but reality was: each slim entry's enforcement had been added piecemeal during PR #104 development, with `specs` left out entirely.

**Three-layer fix:**

1. **`commands/vg/specs.md`** — was the worst gap (no `TodoWrite` in `allowed-tools`, no HARD-GATE block, no `create_task_tracker` step). Added full canonical pattern: `TodoWrite` tool, HARD-GATE language, Red Flags table, Tasklist policy summary, and an IMPERATIVE `create_task_tracker` step right after `emit-tasklist.py` that calls `TodoWrite` then `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter claude` to fire `specs.native_tasklist_projected`.

2. **`blueprint/preflight.md`, `build/preflight.md`, `roam.md`** — these had instruction text saying "call vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected" but no executable bash invocation. AI was empirically skipping the call and relying on the `PostToolUse-TodoWrite` hook to write evidence implicitly. Now the projection emission is bash-enforced; `{cmd}.native_tasklist_projected` MUST fire for `run-complete` to PASS.

3. **Universal Stop-hook gate** in `vg-orchestrator/__main__.py:_verify_contract` — defense-in-depth check. Even if a mainline command's `runtime_contract` forgets to declare the projection event in `must_emit_telemetry`, this universal check blocks `run-complete` with a Bug-D-specific violation message. Mainline set: `specs, scope, blueprint, build, review, test, accept, deploy, roam` (excludes auxiliary `amend`/`polish`/`debug`).

Tests: `tests/test_bug_d_universal_tasklist.py` (35 cases) — every mainline slim entry must list `TodoWrite`, declare `native_tasklist_projected` telemetry, and have proximity-checked enforcement language; every preflight ref must contain explicit bash call; orchestrator gate must list all mainline cmds. Existing tasklist + Bug L tests still pass (52/52 green per fork branch verification).

### Internal

- VERSION + VGFLOW-VERSION → 2.49.3 (patch — 2 cherry-picked feature/fix commits)
- Files cherry-picked: `scripts/hooks/vg-user-prompt-submit.sh` + `.claude/scripts/hooks/vg-user-prompt-submit.sh` (mid-flow), `commands/vg/specs.md` + `roam.md` + `_shared/blueprint/preflight.md` + `_shared/build/preflight.md`, `scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__.py` + `.claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__.py`, `tests/test_bug_d_universal_tasklist.py` (NEW, 191 LOC, 35 cases)
- **Codex mirror regen** — `vg-roam/SKILL.md` + `vg-specs/SKILL.md` regenerated (preserved existing `<codex_skill_adapter>` block, replaced post-adapter body from updated source). 70/70 functional equivalence pass.
- Smoke verified locally: mid-flow injection produces correct `<vg-flow-context>` block on Windows; orchestrator `__main__.py` compiles clean; hook bash syntax OK.
- Credit: both commits authored by @vietnhprintway during PrintwayV3 dogfood follow-up. Cherry-picked since the merge window for PR #104 had closed and PR #106 (which bundled these + 24 already-merged commits) is in CONFLICTING/DIRTY state requiring branch reset.

## v2.49.2 — Codex round-4 security patches + Bug L P6 adapter spoofing (post-merge fork-branch hotfixes)

Patch release. Two hotfixes that landed on the `feat/rfc-v9-followup-fixes` fork branch *after* PR #104 was squash-merged into main, picked up here as cherry-picks. Both target hook gate integrity — the kind of fix that should not wait for the next minor.

### Fixed (commit 78daf5f cherry-pick — Codex round-4 paranoid review)

Codex GPT-5.5 round-4 post-implementation review found 6 Important issues in the PreToolUse-Bash gate. This commit clears 4/6 (24h SLA); remaining 2 (I-3 ts injection redundant w/ this fix; I-6 regex loose-match) deferred to 1-week SLA.

- **I-1: V4 mtime slack inverted safety direction** — `scripts/hooks/vg-pre-tool-use-bash.sh:592` was `ev_mtime + 1 < handled_epoch` (1s slack stacked on 1s timestamp granularity = **2s bypass window**). Now strict `ev_mtime <= handled_epoch` — fails closed in the boundary case.
- **I-2: V4 catch-all fail-OPEN inconsistent with V1/V2/V3 fail-CLOSED** — line 644 was `*) exit 0 ;;` (silent pass on parser errors). Now `emit_block 'handled check failed: ...'` matching depth/run_id catch-alls.
- **I-3: V4 unparseable timestamp swallowed → no-op** — line 589 `except Exception: print('ok')` let bad-ts events downgrade V4. Now prints `unresolved|<ts>` and exits 0 (downstream catches as block).
- **I-4: First-actor JSON injection** — `scripts/lib/blocking-gate-prompt.sh` formatted user-controlled `actor_text` into JSON via raw concatenation. Now uses `python3 -c 'json.dumps(...)'` for safe encoding.
- **I-5: workflow-specs JSON injection** — `scripts/validators/verify-workflow-specs.py` interpolated user error text into JSON output via f-string. Now `json.dumps()`-encoded.

No regression in 117-test delivery suite. Codex round-4 verdict: **APPROVED-WITH-FOLLOWUPS** (0 critical, 6 important; 4/6 cleared in this commit).

### Fixed (commit ef031a7 cherry-pick — Bug L P6 adapter spoofing)

Operator dogfood discovered live during `/vg:blueprint 4.2` on PrintwayV3: tasklist UI not rendered in Claude Code CLI, yet hook accepted evidence and allowed `step-active` to proceed past STEP 1.4. Inspection of `.tasklist-projected.evidence.json`:

```json
"adapter": "fallback"
```

instead of `"claude"`. Codex round-4 missed this — V1/V2/V3/V4 checks all PASS on a fallback-adapter evidence file because contract SHA, HMAC signature, depth_valid, and run_id are all valid; the AI just **never called Claude Code's TodoWrite tool** — it ran:

```bash
vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter fallback
```

which writes evidence directly without invoking the runtime's native projection. Result: contract satisfied for the hook BUT the TodoWrite UI never renders, defeating Bug L Track D's user-visibility goal.

**Fix:** PreToolUse-bash hook (after depth_valid + run_id + handled checks) validates `adapter` when `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` is set:
- `adapter == "claude"` → pass
- `adapter ∈ {"fallback", "codex"}` → BLOCK exit 2 with diagnostic pointing AI to call TodoWrite then re-project with `--adapter claude`
- no `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` (Codex CLI runtime) → adapter check skipped (correct behavior — fallback/codex adapters are valid in non-Claude contexts)

Diagnostic explicitly explains the bypass pattern so AI doesn't repeat it. 8/8 depth-enforcement tests green (4 base + 4 NEW P6 tests covering all 4 adapter cases).

### Internal

- VERSION + VGFLOW-VERSION → 2.49.2 (patch — 2 cherry-picked hotfixes, no new features)
- Files changed (cherry-pick): `scripts/hooks/vg-pre-tool-use-bash.sh` (+adapter-check + I-1/I-2/I-3 fixes), `scripts/lib/blocking-gate-prompt.sh` (I-4), `scripts/validators/verify-workflow-specs.py` (I-5), `tests/test_tasklist_depth_enforcement.py` (+4 new adapter tests). Both `scripts/` and `.claude/scripts/` mirrors stay in sync.
- Codex mirror equivalence verified — no `commands/vg/*.md` modifications in this release, mirrors unchanged.
- Credit: hot patches authored by @vietnhprintway during PrintwayV3 dogfood; landed on fork branch ~30-40 minutes after PR #104 merged. Cherry-picked as v2.49.2 since the merge window for PR #104 had already closed.

## v2.49.1 — `.claude/settings.json` machine-locked path hotfix (PR #104 regression)

Patch release. PR #104 committed `.claude/settings.json` with absolute hook paths baked at install time on one developer's macOS box (`/Users/dzungnguyen/Vibe Code/Code/vgflow-bugfix/scripts/hooks/...`). Every other machine pulling v2.49.0 saw `Stop hook error: bash: <stale path>: No such file or directory` because the file simply does not exist on their disk. Reported immediately after v2.49.0 ship by an operator on a different host; this patch unblocks them and prevents recurrence.

### Fixed

- **`scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh` now emits `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/hooks/<name>.sh`** — Claude Code expands `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` at hook execution time, so the same `settings.json` works on macOS, Linux, Windows, any developer's project root, and any path with spaces. Default mode is now `placeholder`. Set `VG_HOOKS_PATH_MODE=absolute` for the legacy bake-at-install behavior (escape hatch for environments where `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` cannot be relied on).
- **`.claude/settings.json` regenerated** with the new placeholder format. Pulling v2.49.1 directly fixes the broken Stop hook for everyone — no manual intervention needed.
- **TodoWrite|TaskCreate|TaskUpdate matcher** (Issue #105.1, shipped as v2.49.0 fix) now actually appears in the regenerated `settings.json`. The v2.49.0 fix patched `install-hooks.sh` correctly but the committed `settings.json` was never re-emitted, so users still saw the narrow `TodoWrite`-only matcher until they re-ran the installer. v2.49.1 ships the regenerated file.
- **Quoting** — wrapped expanded path in double-quotes (`bash "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/..."`) so paths with spaces survive bash word-splitting after env expansion.

### Internal

- VERSION + VGFLOW-VERSION → 2.49.1 (patch — single-file regen + script behavior change)
- Files changed: `scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh`, `.claude/scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh` (mirror), `.claude/settings.json`
- Verified locally on Windows: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}=D:/Workspace/Messi/Code/vgflow-repo` resolves the hook path correctly; `vg-stop.sh </dev/null` exits 0
- Codex mirror equivalence unchanged (no `commands/vg/*.md` modifications)

### Migration

Existing installs auto-fix on `git pull origin main` — Claude Code re-reads the updated `.claude/settings.json` on next session start. No `sync.sh` re-run needed unless you also want to refresh the hook scripts themselves.

## v2.49.0 — RFC v9 followup batch (PR #104) + harness blocker hotfix (Issue #105)

Minor release. Squash-merge of **PR #104** delivering R2 Test Pilot + R4 Scope/Accept + Hook UX overhaul + RFC v9 backlog cleanup, plus four harness fixes from PrintwayV3 dogfood reported as **Issue #105** by @vietnhprintway. Two maintainer-side CI fixes were applied to PR #104 mid-merge to clear the green bar (`state.current_session_id` mirror desync + `deploy.md` 538-line slim-cap regression).

### Added (PR #104 — features) — closes #100 #101 #102 #103

- **R2 Test Pilot** — `/vg:test` 5-step refactor (preflight → deploy → runtime → goal-verification → codegen → fix-loop → regression+security → close). Heavy steps moved to dedicated subagents (`vg-test-codegen-deep-probe`, `vg-test-goal-verification`, `vg-test-mobile-codegen`). Native tasklist projection enrolled in build/deploy/test for depth-aware progress reporting (Bug L / Task 44b Rule V2).
- **R4 Scope/Accept** — `/vg:scope` 5-round structured discussion (domain → technical → API → UI → tests) with deep-probe loop, env-preference write-through, completeness validation, CrossAI peer review. `/vg:accept` 8-step UAT (preflight → 3-tier gates → checklist build → narrative autofire → interactive → quorum → audit → cleanup) with quorum gate + audit subagent.
- **Hook UX overhaul** — Title-color compact stderr (orange = error, yellow = warn, plain follow-up lines), full diagnostic written to `.vg/blocks/<run_id>/<gate_id>.md` instead of stderr blowout. Cross-run guard with stale (>30min) + run.blocked-unhandled escape clauses, mainline ↔ auxiliary distinction (auxiliary cmds don't hard-block mainline runs on same phase).
- **RFC v9 backlog** — fail-closed build truthcheck cascading into deploy/test, OpenAPI evidence gate hardening, capsule_version "2" graceful-degrade in `verify-task-context-capsule.py`, blueprint mockup-strict per-phase gate.
- **/vg:deploy `--pre-test` mode** for `/vg:build` STEP 6.5 pre-close invocation (sandbox health probe before close).
- **State-machine validator soft-skip** for unknown commands (silent pass instead of hard-block on schema gap — `2fadc394`).
- **Per-task artifact dispatch** in waves (`test_vg_load_per_task_artifacts`) — task executors load only the contracts they bind to, not the whole phase blueprint.

### Fixed (CI maintainer-side, mid-merge)

- **`scripts/vg-orchestrator/state.py` mirror desync** — repo-root canonical was missing `current_session_id()` + `_session_id_from_session_context()` + `CODEX_SESSION_ID` env support that lived in `.claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator/state.py`. CI's `cp -r scripts/* .claude/scripts/` step then overwrote the good copy with the stale mirror, crashing `cmd_run_status` with `AttributeError: module 'state' has no attribute 'current_session_id'`. Fix: sync the two copies (commit `36a5879` on the PR branch). Identified by `cmd_run_status` traceback in run `25307129764`.
- **`commands/vg/deploy.md` 538-line slim-cap regression** — `tests/skills/test_deploy_slim_size.py` enforces `<= 500 LOC` for slim entry. Two new feature commits in this PR (`5853be2` `--pre-test` mode + `b204666` H1+deploy enrollment) re-bloated past the limit set by `cc8e4a6` (refactor r6a). Per the test message, extracted Step 2's inline Python merge-and-summary logic to standalone `scripts/vg-deploy-merge-summary.py` (91 LOC). deploy.md now 488 LOC. Behavior unchanged — same merge semantics, same telemetry payload (commit `9228f46`).

### Fixed (Issue #105 — harness blockers from PrintwayV3 dogfood)

- **#105.1 — PostToolUse matcher hardcoded `TodoWrite` did not fire on `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`**. Claude Code 2026 split the task tool family — newer runtimes expose `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`/`TaskList` instead of (or alongside) `TodoWrite`. With matcher `"TodoWrite"` only, sessions that called `TaskCreate` to project the tasklist never fired the PostToolUse hook → `.tasklist-projected.evidence.json` never written → PreToolUse-Bash gate blocked every `vg-orchestrator step-active` indefinitely. Fix: widen matcher to `"TodoWrite|TaskCreate|TaskUpdate"` in `scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh:50` so the hook fires on all three. Hook body already tolerates `tool_input.todos` being empty (TaskCreate has `subject`+`description` instead).
- **#105.2 — `sync-vg-skills.py` overwriting local matcher patches**. Operator manually patched `.claude/settings.json` line 11 in PrintwayV3 to add the matcher fix; next `python .claude/scripts/sync-vg-skills.py` invocation reverted it within ~1 minute (settings.json is regenerated from `install-hooks.sh` template). Closed structurally by fix #105.1 — applying the matcher widening at the **template level** means subsequent syncs re-emit the correct matcher; no per-install patch needed. Operators upgrading need to re-run `sync.sh` (or `sync-vg-skills.py`) after pulling v2.49.0 to refresh `.claude/settings.json`.
- **#105.3 — `sync-vg-skills.py --check` reported `drift detected (16 items)` with no way to inspect**. New `--verbose` / `--list` flag prints per-item drift detail (skill name + chain + reason) so operators can triage instead of blindly re-running sync. Reads `results[]` already returned by `verify-codex-skill-mirror-sync.py --json`; no validator change needed.
- **#105.4 — `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var not propagated → run_id mismatch between PreToolUse hook and orchestrator subprocess**. Claude Code does NOT export `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` to user-spawned bash, only `CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID` inside the hook process. PreToolUse hook reads `${CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID:-default}` to look up `.vg/active-runs/<sid>.json` while orchestrator's `run-start` sees no session env at all and tags the run with `session-unknown-<rid>` — two different files for the same logical run. Fix: `vg-user-prompt-submit.sh` now writes `.vg/.session-context.json` with `{session_id, run_id, command, phase}`. `state._session_id_from_session_context()` (already shipped in v2.48.0) reads this file as fallback so orchestrator subprocess calls resolve the same session_id the hook used. Closes the orphan `default.json` ↔ `session-unknown-*` divergence.

## v2.48.1 — orchestrator subprocess crash fix (PR #99) + matrix-evidence-link surface-probe schema gap closure (Issue #85)

Patch release — 1 hotfix from PrintwayV3 dogfood (PR #99) + 1 deferred schema-gap fix (Issue #85, deferred since v2.47.1).

### Fixed (PR #99) — `vg-orchestrator` `run-complete` `NameError: subprocess`
- `scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__.py:_verify_artifact_run_binding` used `subprocess.check_output` to resolve git repo root for evidence-manifest verification, but only imported `hashlib`/`json`/`Path` function-locally — never `subprocess`. Whenever an evidence-manifest binding was present (any `must_write` artifact bound to the run), `run-complete` crashed with `NameError: name 'subprocess' is not defined`.
- Cascade impact: `vg-verify-claim.py` stop hook re-fires forever because the previous run never closed → user sees the same red BLOCK message at every prompt until manually `run-abort`.
- Fix: add `import subprocess` to the function-local imports block alongside the existing `hashlib` / `json` / `Path`. One-line change. No behavior change other than not crashing.
- Discovered via PrintwayV3 dogfood (`/vg:review 3.2` re-verification, 2026-05-02).
- Credit: PR #99 from @vietnhprintway (commit `feab9f3` on `fix/orchestrator-subprocess-import`).

### Fixed (Issue #85) — matrix-evidence-link surface-probe schema gap
- `verify-matrix-evidence-link.py` only inspects RUNTIME-MAP `goal_sequences[]` to verify matrix Status. Backend goals (surface ∈ {api, data, integration, time-driven}) get probed via `surface-probe.sh` during Phase 4a and their results land in `.surface-probe-results.json` — NOT in RUNTIME-MAP. Without this fix, matrix Status=READY for a backend goal looked "ungrounded" to the validator and BLOCKed review. PrintwayV3 Phase 3.2 dogfood: 32 non-UI goals (13 api + 7 data + 7 integration + 5 time-driven) flagged as `matrix_status_without_runtime_sequence` despite legitimate probe verification.
- Fix path chosen: **option (a)** from #85 — single-file ground truth. New script `scripts/backfill-surface-probe-runtime.py` reads `.surface-probe-results.json` after Phase 4a writes it and merges synthetic `goal_sequences[gid]` entries into RUNTIME-MAP.json. Validator continues to read only RUNTIME-MAP — no validator change needed.
- Synthetic entry shape: `{synthetic: true, source: "surface_probe", surface, result, evidence_ref: ".surface-probe-results.json#G-XX", evidence_text, steps: [{do: "probe", target: "surface-probe:<surface>", evidence: {source: "surface_probe", evidence_ref: "..."}}]}`.
- Status mapping: `READY → "passed"`, `BLOCKED → "blocked"`, `INFRA_PENDING → "infra_pending"`, `UNREACHABLE → "unreachable"`. `SKIPPED` produces no entry (falls through to NOT_SCANNED branch as documented).
- Idempotent: re-runs overwrite synthetic entries by gid; real browser-recorded sequences (no `synthetic: true` flag) are NEVER overwritten — defended via explicit guard in `merge_synthetic`.
- Wired into `commands/vg/review.md` Phase 4a immediately after `.surface-probe-results.json` write, so every `/vg:review` run that produces probe results auto-backfills RUNTIME-MAP.
- Verified end-to-end against fixture: 4 status types (READY/BLOCKED/INFRA_PENDING/SKIPPED) handled correctly; real entry G-99 preserved untouched on rerun.

### Internal
- VERSION + VGFLOW-VERSION → 2.48.1 (patch — 1 hotfix + 1 schema-gap closure, no new feature).
- New script: `scripts/backfill-surface-probe-runtime.py` (~220 lines, AST-validated, idempotent).
- 28 targeted tests pass (test_profile_aware_contracts 10/10 + test_phaseP_real_verification 18/18).
- Codex skill mirrors regenerated via `bash sync.sh --no-global` (78 changes, including .claude/scripts/backfill-surface-probe-runtime.py + updated review.md).
- Issue #85 closed (deferred since v2.47.1; workaround via `migrate-backend-surface-probe.py` shipped in PR #86 / v2.48.0; option (a) closes the upstream schema gap once and for all).

## v2.48.0 — RFC v9 follow-up (PR #86) + 3 dogfood-found phase-profile/CRLF fixes (Issues #88 #89 #90)

Mixed feature + patch release. **PR #86** (RFC v9 follow-up: fail-closed build truthcheck + OpenAPI evidence gate, held in v2.47.x because of bypass-test conflicts) merged green. On top of it, 3 new dogfood reports from PrintwayV3 surfaced after #87 was patched: 2 in `phase-profile.sh` migration detection, 1 in config-loader CRLF handling. Issues #91-#98 were filed at the same time but were already addressed by PR #86 / v2.47.1 / v2.47.2 — they are closed as "fixed in this release" without code changes (see Triage below).

### Added (PR #86 — RFC v9 follow-up)
- **Fail-closed build truthcheck + OpenAPI evidence gate** in `/vg:build`: contract-bearing wave failures BLOCK; route-schema coverage and goal-grounding now enforced before late UI scan loops.
- **RFC v9 tester-pro gates** wired through `/vg:scope`, `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:review`, `/vg:test` — `tester-pro-cli.py`, `route-schema-backfill.py`, `migrate-backend-surface-probe.py`, `review-api-contract-probe.py`, `backfill-goal-traceability.py`.
- **Diagnostic L2 fallback wiring** for `/vg:review` Phase 3 fix loop (`spawn-diagnostic-l2.py` + `runtime/__init__.py` integration).
- **Orchestrator `no-session` resolution fix** — synthetic `session-unknown-*` runs can now be completed by later subprocesses instead of orphaning telemetry on CI runners without `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`.
- **3 new validators**: `verify-route-schema-coverage.py`, `verify-goal-grounding.py`, `verify-runtime-wired.py`.
- **`sync.sh` ships `catalog/edge-cases/*.md`** so fresh installs include the seed pattern store consumed by `runtime/pattern_catalog.py`.
- **Codex skill mirrors regenerated** for all 70 skills with the new RFC v9 gates.

### Fixed (Issue #89) — `phase-profile.sh` Rule 5 schema-path false positive on Mongoose / GraphQL / Joi files
- `commands/vg/_shared/lib/phase-profile.sh` migration detection counted any PLAN.md `<file-path>` containing the substring `schema` as a migration signal. PrintwayV3 Phase 3.2 (Mongoose-backed payment gateway) had ≥2 model files like `apps/api/src/models/topup.schema.js`, `apps/api/src/models/withdraw.schema.js` — passed the v2.47.1 quorum (≥2) trivially → wrongly classified as migration → required ROLLBACK.md → user forced manual override at every `/vg:review`.
- Fix: narrow the path regex from generic `(migrations|schema|\.sql)` substring to actual migration paths only:
  - `(^|/)(migrations?|migrate)/` — Knex/Sequelize/Rails-style migration directories.
  - `(^|/)prisma/schema\.prisma$` — Prisma schema, exact filename only.
  - `(^|/)db/schema\.(rb|sql)$` — Rails-style schema dumps.
  - `\.sql$` — raw SQL files (kept for backward compat with v2.47.1 fixtures).
- Mongoose model files (`models/UserSchema.js`, `schemas/userSchema.js`), GraphQL types (`graphql/schema.ts`), Joi/Yup validators (`validation/schema.json`) NO LONGER trigger migration profile.
- Verified via 4 fixture tests: Mongoose schemas → feature; real `migrations/*.sql` → migration; single `prisma/schema.prisma` → feature (no quorum); zero-match PLAN → feature.

### Fixed (Issue #90) — `phase-profile.sh` `grep -cE ... || echo 0` produced double-zero
- Same line as #89: `mig_path_count=$(grep -cE '...' "$plan" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)`. When grep finds 0 matches, it prints `0` and exits with rc=1 → the `|| echo 0` clause appended a SECOND `0` → `mig_path_count="0\n0"` → `[ "$mig_path_count" -ge 2 ]` triggered shell integer-comparison warnings ("integer expression expected") on every phase-profile detection that hit Rule 5's prose match.
- Fix: replaced with a 2-stage extract (`grep -oE` → `sed`) feeding `grep -cE` inside `{ ...; || true; }` braces. Result: clean `0` / `N` integer, no double-zero, no rc=1 leak. Wrapped the integer test with `2>/dev/null` for defense-in-depth on legacy Bash variants.

### Fixed (Issue #88) — config-loader CRLF stripping for Windows-checkout repos
- `.claude/vg.config.md` parsed by awk patterns across `config-loader.md`, `commands/vg/{blueprint,build,review,test}.md`, `commands/vg/_shared/mobile-deploy.md`. On Windows-checkout repos with CRLF line endings, awk's `print` produced shell vars with embedded `\r` — e.g. `PLANNING_DIR=".vg\r"` → `resolve_phase_dir` looked for `.vg\r/phases/<phase>` which never exists → BLOCK on every Codex `/vg:review` run with `resolve_phase_dir: phases directory missing at '.vg\r/phases'`.
- Fix (defense-in-depth):
  - **BOM-strip stage** in `config-loader.md` now also strips `\r$` line-by-line: `sed -e '1s/^\xEF\xBB\xBF//' -e 's/\r$//' .claude/vg.config.md > "$CONFIG_CLEAN"`.
  - **All `tr -d '"'` pipelines** changed to `tr -d '"\r'` (config-loader graphify/model awk, blueprint UI_MAP_*, build UI_MAP_*/MAX_*, test STORAGE_*/LOGIN_STRATEGY, mobile-deploy target_platforms).
  - **`vg_config_get` + `vg_config_get_array` awk gsub** extended from `gsub(/["]/, "")` to `gsub(/["\r]/, "")`.
  - **`commands/vg/review.md` mobile DEVICE awk gsub** + `commands/vg/test.md` ROLES awk gsub extended with `\r`.
  - **`GRAPHIFY_STALE_WARN`** (only awk-based, no `tr`) gained a `| tr -d '\r'` postfilter.
  - **`commands/vg/test.md` STORAGE_TTL** (numeric, no `tr`) gained a `| tr -d '\r'` postfilter.

## v2.47.2 — `verify-no-no-verify` self-flagging fix (Issue #87)

Critical hotfix on top of v2.47.1. `verify-no-no-verify.py` validator was self-flagging its own test fixture, gate-manifest.json, and educational comments in source — returning BLOCK with 30+ violations on a clean v2.47.1 install. This blocked every `/vg:* run-complete` because no `--skip-verify-no-no-verify` flag existed. Workaround was `vg-orchestrator run-abort` after every run.

### Fixed (Issue #87)
- **Allowlist anchored to wrong path layout**: pre-fix `^\.claude/scripts/...` regex matched only user installs, not vgflow-repo source layout. The validator's own file, its own test fixture, and `gate-manifest.json` all self-flagged when scanned from source. Now uses `(^|/)scripts/validators/...` which matches both layouts.
- **`gate-manifest.json` allowlisted** — contains the literal `--no-verify` string inside frozen gate-block hash data (not as an executable command). Pre-fix flagged as 1 BLOCK.
- **`tests/test_no_no_verify.py` + `scripts/tests/test_no_no_verify.py` allowlisted** — these intentionally carry `--no-verify` literals as repro fixtures.
- **`is_in_negative_example()` extended for source-code prose**: added markers `MUST NOT`, `must not`, `Bypass:`, `bypass:`, `anti --no-verify`, `no-no-verify`, `non-negotiable`, `(already banned)`, `already banned`. Now docstrings/comments educating about the rule (e.g. `vg-orchestrator/__main__.py:2762-2766` comment "anti --no-verify bypass... Source code MUST NOT contain --no-verify", `verify-rule-cards-fresh-hook.py:29` docstring "Bypass: git commit --no-verify (already banned)") are recognized as legitimate.
- **Source-code severity routing rewritten**: pre-fix any `--no-verify` mention in `.py`/`.sh`/`.ts` was unconditionally BLOCK. Now: negative-example marker on same line → skip; `#`/`//`/docstring comment without marker → WARN (advisory); plain code → BLOCK (real bypass intent).

### Triaged
- **Issue #85** stays open as tracker (matrix-evidence-link non-UI goals schema gap; same status as v2.47.1).
- **PR #86** — reporter pushed an additional commit (`99d7232`: fail-closed build truthcheck + OpenAPI evidence gate) but did NOT fix the bypass-test conflict. CI still red on `test_bypass_negative.py` 7/10. Held until reporter aligns tests OR refactors run-complete to distinguish "orphan recoverable" from "no run at all" with separate exit codes.

## v2.47.1 — 3 dogfood-found schema-violations (Issues #82 #83 #84)

Patch release fixing 3 of 4 v2.47.0 schema_violation issues filed by PrintwayV3 dogfood. Issue #85 (matrix-evidence-link non-UI goals schema gap) deferred — reporter shipped a workaround in PR #86 (currently CI-red); upstream fix is follow-up. PR #86 itself NOT merged yet — `test_bypass_negative.py` 7/10 fails because orphan-run-blocking fix changed run-complete exit code semantics, needs test alignment.

### Fixed (Issue #82) — phase-profile false positive on "migration" word
- `commands/vg/_shared/lib/phase-profile.sh` Rule 5 was over-eager: any SPECS.md mention of "migration" tripped the migration profile, even when it referred to "deferred destructive-migration notes" or "data migration plan in Phase 6" inside a feature spec. PrintwayV3 Phase 3.2 (topup/withdraw payment gateway) was mis-detected → required ROLLBACK.md (didn't exist) → user forced manual override at every `/vg:review`.
- Fix: 3-tier detection.
  - **Tier 1 (strongest):** `migration_plan:` frontmatter in SPECS → trust without further checks.
  - **Tier 2:** SPECS mentions migration words AND PLAN.md lists ≥2 file-paths matching `migrations|schema|.sql` (was: 1 path).
  - **Tier 3 (fallback):** SPECS explicitly references migration tooling commands (`prisma migrate`, `sqlx migrate`, `knex migrate`, `alembic upgrade`, `django ... makemigrations`). Pre-fix the bare prose mention of `migrations/` or `.sql` was enough — root cause of the false positive.

### Fixed (Issue #83) — emit-event signature drift in review.md
- `commands/vg/review.md:730` step `0a_env_mode_gate` called `emit-event --event-type X --phase Y --command Z --actor skill --outcome INFO --payload {...}` but argparse schema is `emit-event [--payload P] [--step S] [--actor {orchestrator,hook,validator,llm-claimed,user}] [--outcome {PASS,BLOCK,WARN,INFO}] EVENT_TYPE_POSITIONAL`. Drift: (a) `--event-type` flag instead of positional, (b) `--phase`/`--command` flags not in schema, (c) `--actor=skill` not in enum.
- Result: every emit-event call failed with `unrecognized arguments` OR `invalid choice: skill`. stderr redirected via `2>&1 || true` masked the failure → `review.env_mode_confirmed` events never recorded → telemetry contract silently broken.
- Fix: positional event_type, `--actor llm-claimed` (closest enum match for skill-driven calls), phase + command moved into payload JSON. Verified no other broken sites in review.md/build.md/test.md/blueprint.md/scope.md via sweep grep.

### Fixed (Issue #84) — `verify-matrix-evidence-link.py` BLOCKED status gap
- `STATUSES_WITHOUT_RUNTIME = {INFRA_PENDING, UNREACHABLE, DEFERRED}` excluded BLOCKED. When matrix Status=BLOCKED matched runtime `goal_sequences[gid].result='blocked'` (semantically aligned, both saying "this failed"), validator still flagged `matrix_status_contradicts_runtime_result` with confusing message "matrix wrote a success status" (it didn't — it wrote BLOCKED).
- Workaround was: use DEFERRED instead of BLOCKED, losing the "I observed a real failure" semantics.
- Fix: (a) BLOCKED added to STATUSES_WITHOUT_RUNTIME for the steps-empty branch; (b) explicit alignment short-circuit `if status == "BLOCKED" and result in {blocked, failed, error}: continue` before the contradiction-flag branch.

### Triaged
- **Issue #85** stays open as tracker — reporter shipped a workaround tool (`migrate-backend-surface-probe.py`) in PR #86 for legacy-phase migration; the underlying schema gap (non-UI goals don't appear in `goal_sequences[]`) is deferred. Two paths discussed: (a) Phase 2b-3 collect step writes synthetic `goal_sequences[gid] = {result: 'verified-via-surface-probe', ...}` for non-UI goals, OR (b) extend validator to read `.surface-probe-results.json` as second evidence source. Option (a) preferred per single-file ground truth principle.
- **PR #86** (RFC v9 follow-up) NOT merged — CI red on bypass tests. Held until reporter aligns tests or refactors run-complete exit-code semantics. Comment posted on PR #86.

## v2.47.0 — RFC v9 implementation: test-data prerequisites + fixture runtime (PR #81 + Windows compat)

Massive feature batch: full RFC v9 (PR #80) implementation across 16 logical sub-PRs bundled into PR #81. **14677 insertions, 7 deletions, 74 files.** Closes the meta-bug surfaced in v2.46.1 dogfood: 21/36 mutation goals SUSPECTED not because validators/scanners failed but because **sandbox seed lacked realistic application state** to verify mutations against.

### Added (PR-pre-A) — Foundation schemas + provenance gates
- `schemas/fixture-recipe.v1.json` — D2 recipe schema (allocation, lifecycle, retry, side_effect_risk, validate_after, idempotency-required for POST/PUT).
- `schemas/data-invariants.v1.json` — D5 N-consumer schema (`consume_semantics: destructive|read_only`, `isolation: per_consumer|shared_when_read_only`).
- `scripts/validators/verify-evidence-provenance.py` — D10 structured provenance gate.
- `scripts/validators/verify-matrix-staleness.py` — D10 trustworthy provenance bidirectional sync (executor evidence cannot promote SUSPECTED→READY).
- `scripts/migrate-legacy-provenance.py` — pre-v9 mutation step tagger.

### Added (PR-A1+A2+A3) — Native Python recipe runtime
- `scripts/runtime/recipe_loader.py` — YAML + jsonschema validation.
- `scripts/runtime/recipe_capture.py` — JSONPath capture (jsonpath-ng + stdlib fallback) with cardinality enforcement.
- `scripts/runtime/recipe_interpolate.py` — `${var}` interpolation, type-preserving whole-string match.
- `scripts/runtime/recipe_safety.py` — D9 sandbox safety gate (X-VGFlow-Sandbox + sentinel markers).
- `scripts/runtime/recipe_auth.py` — 4 auth handlers (cookie_login, api_key, bearer_jwt with refresh, command sandbox-only).
- `scripts/runtime/recipe_executor.py` — RecipeRunner: role auth → interpolation → safety → idempotency-key → 401 refresh → capture → ${var} export.
- `scripts/runtime/fixture_cache.py` — content-addressed cache by recipe hash + lease TTL + atomic rename on save.

### Added (PR-B/C/D/E/F) — Skill wiring + diagnostic L2 + codegen
- Wires fixture system into `/vg:specs`, `/vg:scope`, `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:build`, `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`.
- `scripts/spawn-diagnostic-l2.py` — adversarial sub-agent for blocked gates (D11 confidence-based remediation).
- `scripts/codegen-fixture-inject.py` — emit `// VGFLOW_FIXTURE_INJECTED — DO NOT EDIT` block from FIXTURES/G-XX.yaml into Playwright specs.
- `scripts/runtime/preflight_invariants.py` + `scripts/runtime/rcrurd_preflight.py` — pre-state assertion (data exists in shape needed) + post-state assertion (mutation actually changed shape).

### Fixed (Windows compat shims for PR #81)
External dogfood reporter shipped from macOS without Windows compat. v2.47.0 ships these on top:
- `scripts/runtime/fixture_cache.py` — `fcntl` is POSIX-only; added `msvcrt.locking` fallback for Windows + no-op degradation if neither primitive available. Pre-fix: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fcntl'` blocked entire test suite collection on Windows.
- `tests/test_recipe_auth.py` + `tests/test_spawn_diagnostic_l2.py` — `f"{sys.executable} {script}"` joins path-with-spaces (`C:\Users\Lionel Messi\...`) with bare space, breaking `shlex.split` round-trip. Replaced with `shlex.join([str(sys.executable), str(script)])`.
- `tests/test_codegen_fixture_inject.py` + `tests/test_fixture_backfill.py` — `Path.read_text()` defaults to locale encoding (cp1252 on Windows en, cp1258 on VN), mojibake-decoding the em-dash in `VGFLOW_FIXTURE_INJECTED — DO NOT EDIT` sentinel. Added `encoding="utf-8"` to all read sites.

### Internal
- 628 tests pass (was 243 — PR #81 added ~385 new tests).
- 4 skipped (pre-existing).
- 8 tests skipped on Windows local due to WinError 10106 TCP socket flake (`test_preflight_invariants_runner.py`, `test_rcrurd_preflight_runner.py`) — runs clean in CI (Ubuntu) and reporter's macOS. Environmental, not code.
- 70 codex skills (no new skill files; runtime is library-style).
- `VGFLOW-VERSION` + `VERSION` synced to 2.47.0 (minor — large feature batch).
- Credit: PR #81 from @vietnhprintway; Windows compat shims by maintainer.

### Note on test count
- 386 net tests added (243 → 628 + 8 windows-skipped). Coverage of recipe runtime, fixture cache, auth handlers, codegen injection, diagnostic L2 spawning, preflight runners, schema validation.

## v2.46.1 — Recovery paths + autonomous fix loop + matrix-staleness gate (PR #79)

3-wave companion to v2.46.0 (anti-performative-review). Closes additional dogfood gaps surfaced while running `/vg:review 3.2` on PrintwayV3. 1274 insertions, 7 deletions, 8 files.

### Added (wave-3) — Recovery paths per violation type
When a validator BLOCKs, orchestrator now prints **concrete recovery commands per violation type** (RECOMMENDED + override + workflow alternatives) instead of dead-ending with `[validator:foo] failed`. 11 violation types covered.
- NEW `scripts/vg-orchestrator/recovery_paths.py` — lookup table + builder for recovery hints.
- NEW `scripts/vg-recovery.py` — interactive picker (used by `/vg:doctor recovery`).
- `scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__._format_block_message` enriched with recovery section.

### Added (wave-3.1) — Autonomous fix loop in Stop hook
- `scripts/vg-verify-claim.py` Stop hook now tries safe recovery paths **automatically before printing BLOCK**.
- Only `auto_executable: True` paths run — override-flag style, NEVER destructive `--retry-failed` reruns or other side-effecting paths.
- If recovery succeeds: hook re-attempts orchestrator `run-complete` and emits approve event with telemetry. Reduces "human stuck on trivial gate" friction.

### Added (wave-3.2) — Matrix-staleness gate (`verify-matrix-staleness.py`)
Phase 3.2 dogfood verdict=PASS with 65 READY / 67 goals, but real sandbox testing showed approve/reject buttons systematically failing. The gate didn't catch because matrix said READY based on stale prior runs.
- NEW `scripts/validators/verify-matrix-staleness.py` cross-checks `goal_sequences[].steps[]` against TEST-GOALS.md `mutation_evidence`.
- Marks goal SUSPECTED if matrix=READY AND (no_sequence | no_submit_step | submit_no_2xx).
- Runs at review entry (`--apply-status-update` mutates matrix → SUSPECTED so `--retry-failed` picks them up) and again at review-complete (catches new staleness from current run).

### Internal
- 243 tests pass.
- 70 codex skills.
- `VGFLOW-VERSION` + `VERSION` synced to 2.46.1 (patch — additive recovery + new validator).

## v2.46.0 — Anti-performative-review enforcement + 3 dogfood-found bugs (PR #74 + Issues #76, #77, #78)

Bundles PR #74 (4050 lines, 35 files — anti-performative-review enforcement) plus 3 dogfood-discovered bug fixes. PrintwayV3 Phase 3.5 + 3.2 dogfood arc.

### Major (PR #74) — Anti-performative-review enforcement

External dogfood reported a critical pattern: scanner CSRF-blocked-then-classified-as-"expected-security" → goal `passed` → matrix passed → `/vg:test` reads passed → bug ships. Phase 3.2: 5 goals (G-31, G-34, G-35, G-44, G-52) marked passed when `goal_sequences.steps[]` had no submit click. Performative review.

**Root cause:** Scanner in `/vg:review` (vg-haiku-scanner) defaulted to Cancel modals to avoid mutating sandbox data. But sandbox declares `disposable_seed_data: true` — that's the ENVIRONMENT to mutate. Scanner refused to submit → never tested happy path → CSRF/auth/idempotency bugs slip through.

**4 enforcement layers added:**
1. `scanner-report-contract.md` — banned vocabulary: "expected security", "as designed", "expected behavior", "working as intended", "cancel" (when explaining mutation goal).
2. New validators (8): `verify-decisions-to-tasks`, `verify-decisions-trace`, `verify-goal-traceability`, `verify-mutation-actually-submitted`, `verify-rcrurd-depth`, `verify-replay-evidence`, `verify-scanner-business-alignment`, `verify-test-traces-to-rule`.
3. Scanner workflow updates: roam.md + vg-haiku-scanner SKILL.md now enforce mutation submit when phase has `disposable_seed_data: true`.
4. Decision/goal traceability gates wired into review.md late stages.

### Fixed (Issue #76) — `vg_commit_with_files` msg-first misuse detection
- Reporter found 4+ subagents in /vg:build session got wrong invocation: `vg_commit_with_files "feat(10-02): subject" file1 file2` (Conventional Commit subject as first arg) instead of `vg_commit_with_files <task_id> <max_wait_secs> <msg_file_path> <file>...`. Each agent had to soft-reset + retry after helper returned usage error.
- Fix: helper now detects Conventional Commit subjects in `task_id` arg (case match on `feat(...`, `fix(...`, `docs(...`, etc.) and emits a targeted error explaining the correct shape with example. Generic "missing args" message no longer hides the real misuse pattern.

### Fixed (Issue #77) — Untracked source files at end of /vg:build
- PrintwayV3 Phase 3.5 Wave 8: build executor created 2 source files (~920 LOC total: `apps/api/src/workers/queues/receipt-generation.queue.ts` + `apps/api/src/workers/receipt-generation.worker.ts`), forgot `git add` for both. Local typecheck PASSED (files in fs), 3 import sites referenced them via `.js` paths, sandbox `git pull` only saw committed files → `pnpm turbo run build` failed with TS2307 "Cannot find module" for all 3 import sites.
- Fix: NEW `scripts/validators/verify-no-untracked-source.py` — walks working tree, finds files matching source extensions (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.py`, `.rb`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.kt`, `.swift`, `.sql`, `.graphql`, `.prisma`), checks each via `git status --porcelain`, BLOCKs if any source file is untracked. Default excludes for `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.vg/`, test/spec scaffolding, build caches.
- Validator runs at end of `/vg:build` (caller wires it before sandbox push).

### Fixed (Issue #78) — CrossAI subtask letter naming false-positives
- CrossAI `/vg:build` verification at iter1: extracted task IDs from PLAN.md as `\d+`, stripped letter suffixes ("3b" → "3" duplicate of Task 3), counted unique numeric IDs → reported phantom missing tasks ("tasks 31-36 missing" — those numbers don't exist; engine confused subtask letters with high task IDs).
- Phase 3.5 actual subtask IDs that triggered: `3b`, `11b`, `11c`, `15a`, `15b`, `22b`. Also flagged: commit subjects starting with `test(` or `docs(` (valid Conventional Commits) treated as wrong type.
- Fix: prompt brief in `scripts/vg-build-crossai-loop.py` now explicitly tells the LLM verifier to (a) accept letter suffixes as parent-task variants (`3b` and `3` are the same parent), (b) accept any of `feat | fix | docs | style | refactor | perf | test | chore | revert | build | ci` as Conventional Commit prefix.

### Internal
- 243 tests pass.
- 70 codex skills.
- `VGFLOW-VERSION` + `VERSION` synced to 2.46.0 (minor — additive enforcement layer + new validator).
- Credit: PR #74 + 3 issues all from @vietnhprintway (PrintwayV3 Phase 3.2 + 3.5 dogfood arc — same week as #57–#73).

### Defensive note
- 8 new validators from PR #74 not auto-wired into all phases; caller must invoke each at the appropriate gate. Registry entries added; explicit step wiring is follow-up work.

## v2.45.1 — Windows VN-locale subprocess fix + AI semantic UI scope detection (Issue #72 + PR #73)

### Fixed (Issue #72) — `design-normalize.py` Windows VN-locale `subprocess.run`
- `scripts/design-normalize.py:221` `subprocess.run(text=True)` was missing `encoding=`. On Windows VN locale (cp1258) and other non-Western locales, default codec couldn't decode UTF-8 bytes ≥ 0x80 emitted by Playwright stdout (em-dash, smart quotes) → `UnicodeDecodeError` → `result.stdout` becomes `None` → manifest aggregator marks all assets as `failed` with `AttributeError 'NoneType' has no attribute strip`, even when PNG screenshots + structural refs DID render successfully on disk.
- Fix: add `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"` (same pattern as v2.41.3's `vg_update.py` fix for Issue #53 Bug #1).
- Affects: blueprint step `0_design_discovery` for entire UI phase pipeline on any Windows non-en locale (vi, zh, ja, etc.).

### Added (PR #73) — AI semantic UI scope detection (replaces grep heuristic)
- `/vg:blueprint` step `0_design_discovery` previously used keyword grep on SPECS+CONTEXT to decide `has_ui`, gating downstream UI steps (`2b6_ui_spec` / `2b6b_ui_map` / `2b6c_view_decomposition`). Three failure modes: (1) false-positive on exclusion clauses ("CHỈ build backend, UI Ở Phase 6/7/8" matched `UI` literally), (2) false-positive from PLAN residue, (3) silent UI gap when SPECS describes UI in prose but planner spawned 0 FE tasks.
- NEW `scripts/preflight/detect-ui-scope.py` — Haiku 4.5 reads SPECS+CONTEXT, outputs structured JSON `{has_ui, confidence, evidence, deferred_to, ui_kinds}`. Distinguishes scope-INCLUSION from scope-EXCLUSION clauses.
- Confidence routing (matches `goal-classifier.sh` pattern): ≥0.8 auto-apply + cache `.ui-scope.json`; 0.5–0.8 tie-break (adversarial AI or AskUserQuestion); <0.5 BLOCK unless `--allow-ui-scope-uncertain`.
- NEW `scripts/validators/verify-ui-scope-coherence.py` — gate UI-bearing scope vs PLAN.md FE task presence.

### Internal
- 243 tests pass.
- 70 codex skills.
- `VGFLOW-VERSION` + `VERSION` synced to 2.45.1 (patch — issue fix + targeted feature).
- Credit: Issue #72 auto-reported via vg-bug-reporter (Windows VN dogfood). PR #73 from @vietnhprintway (continued PrintwayV3 dogfood arc).

### Defensive note
- Other `subprocess.run(text=True)` sites in repo were NOT swept for the same encoding bug (would be scope creep). Same pattern likely affects `bootstrap-test-runner.py`, `build-caller-graph.py`, `design-reverse.py`, etc. — open separate issues if hit on Windows non-en locales.

## v2.45.0 — `/vg:debug` skill + scanner Tier A-G + fail-closed validators + multi-session race fix (PRs #68–#71)

Bundles 4 dogfood-driven PRs from @vietnhprintway into a single minor release: 2957 insertions, 73 deletions, 22 files. PRs shipped within ~1 hour after v2.44.0 hit `latest`.

| PR | Lines | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| #68 | +1/-1 | `crossai-loop` `timezone` import (`NameError` since v2.28.0) |
| #69 | +344/-29 | Multi-session `run_id` race fix in 4 validators + 9 new tests |
| #70 | +551/-38 | Fail-closed validators (closes Phase 3.2 dogfood gap — false-PASS) |
| #71 | +2081/-5 | NEW `/vg:debug` skill + scanner-report-contract + Tier A-G + ÉP enforcement |

### Added — `/vg:debug` skill (PR #71, commit 1)
Lightweight bug-fix loop alternative to `/vg:review` (3-5 min vs 15-30 min). Natural-language input → auto-classify (static / runtime_ui / network / infra / spec_gap) → fix loop with `AskUserQuestion` (fixed / retry / more-info). Spec gap → auto-routes to `/vg:amend`.

### Added — Scanner-report-contract + Tier A-G capability matrix (PR #71, commit 2)
NEW `commands/vg/_shared/scanner-report-contract.md` (8 sections: banned vocab, JSON schema with 30+ fields, Tier A-G capability matrix, per-lens defaults). Codifies **discover-only principle**: scanners (CLI/Haiku) report observations only — NEVER verdicts, severity, or prescriptions. Verdict assignment is downstream (orchestrator). Updates `roam.md` + `skills/vg-haiku-scanner/SKILL.md` to consume contract.

### Added — ÉP enforcement (PR #71, commit 3)
- `scripts/scanner-evidence-capture.js` — captures evidence at scanner output boundary.
- `scripts/verify-scanner-evidence-completeness.py` — validator that scanner outputs include all required Tier A-G fields per lens.

### Fixed (PR #68) — `crossai-loop` `timezone` import
- `scripts/vg-build-crossai-loop.py:577` calls `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` but line 53 only imported `datetime` → `NameError: name 'timezone' is not defined` on first invocation.
- Bug shipped in v2.28.0 when `_resolve_active_run` was added; persisted through v2.44.0. 1-line import fix.

### Fixed (PR #69) — Multi-session `run_id` resolution + `current-run.json` race
- 4 validators (`build-crossai-required`, `build-graphify-required`, `verify-clean-failure-state`, `verify-artifact-freshness`) read `.vg/current-run.json` raw to determine which `run_id` to evaluate.
- v2.28.0 introduced `.vg/active-runs/{session_id}.json` as per-session authority; only `vg-build-crossai-loop._resolve_active_run` + `vg-orchestrator.state.read_active_run` had been migrated.
- Concurrent `/vg:*` sessions: every `run-start` overwrote `current-run.json` → validators evaluated FOREIGN session's `run_id` during `run-complete` → spurious BLOCK on healthy runs.
- Fix: shared `_resolve_active_run` helper used by all 4 validators; `current-run.json` becomes legacy fallback only. New `tests/test_validator_active_run_resolver.py` (9 tests).

### Fixed (PR #70) — Fail-closed validators

Closes the largest dogfood-found false-positive class to date: validators
silently passing on format mismatch / regex miss / parse failure. PrintwayV3
Phase 3.2 review claimed 65/67 goals READY while RUNTIME-MAP showed 27
sequences recorded (10 passed, 11 blocked, 6 deferred-structural) and 40
goals never replayed. User reported admin topup approve/flag forms
crashing in browser — validators that should have caught this all returned
PASS or WARN.

### Fixed — `verify-runtime-map-coverage.py` parses markdown TEST-GOALS

Validator was YAML-frontmatter-only. Phase 3.2 used `## Goal G-XX:` markdown
headers → 0 goals parsed → return 0 with "(no parseable goals — passing)".
Now: tries YAML first, falls back to markdown parser supporting `## Goal G-XX:`
+ `**Field:** value` lines. **FAIL CLOSED** if neither format matches —
previously silently passed.

### Fixed — `verify-runtime-map-crud-depth.py` mutation vocabulary

`MUTATION_WORD_RE` only matched create/update/delete/submit/save. Admin
state-transition verbs (approve/reject/flag/reset/enable/etc.) bypassed the
gate, so `goal_sequence` with only a list-render step satisfied "depth"
checks for mutation goals. Expanded vocabulary to cover: approve, reject,
flag, unflag, enable, disable, activate, deactivate, reset, cancel,
archive, restore, publish, lock, unlock, freeze, unfreeze, suspend, resume,
verify, confirm, deny, assign, unassign, transfer, upload, download +
Vietnamese (duyệt, từ chối, đánh dấu, mở khóa, kích hoạt, vô hiệu, hủy,
chuyển).

### Added — `verify-matrix-evidence-link.py` validator

Cross-checks GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md status verdicts against the runtime
evidence they claim to summarize (RUNTIME-MAP.json goal_sequences[].result).

Catches three fabrication classes:
- `matrix_status_without_runtime_sequence` — matrix=READY but no sequence entry
- `matrix_status_with_empty_sequence` — sequence shell with 0 steps
- `matrix_status_contradicts_runtime_result` — matrix=READY but result=blocked

Statuses that legitimately don't need runtime evidence: INFRA_PENDING,
UNREACHABLE, DEFERRED. All others require non-empty sequence with result in
{passed, ready, ok, deferred-structural}.

Wired into `commands/vg/review.md` end-of-step block — runs before
`vg-orchestrator run-complete`. Phase 3.2 dogfood: 55 mismatches (40 missing
+ 11 contradicts + 4 empty).

### Fixed — `verify-contract-runtime.py` accepts level-3 endpoint headers

Regex `^##\s+METHOD /path` only matched level-2 headers. Phase 3.2
API-CONTRACTS.md used `### POST /api/v1/...` (level 3) under group headers
(level 2) → 0 endpoints parsed → WARN "empty_contract" → silently passed.
Now: matches `##` / `###` / `####` headers. **FAIL CLOSED** on empty
contract (was WARN).

### Patched — `commands/vg/test.md` removed silent CRUD fallback

Branching table v2.32.1 said: `READY + missing goal_sequences[G-XX] + CRUD
match → Sinh structural spec from CRUD-SURFACES.md`. Phase 3.2 dogfood:
this fallback turned 40 goals (review never replayed) into list-render
.spec.ts with no mutation evidence → /vg:test PASS while production
buttons crashed.

New default: `READY + missing seq` → BLOCK with re-review hint. Legacy
fallback preserved behind `--allow-structural-fallback` flag (logs
override-debt). The `matrix-evidence-link` validator at review-exit now
catches the mismatch upstream, so this fallback should rarely be reached.

### Architecture rule (added to skill prose)

> Validators MUST fail-closed on parse error / format drift / regex miss.
> Returning PASS/WARN when the validator cannot enforce its invariant
> means the gate has been silently bypassed. The default for unparseable
> input is BLOCK with a hint to fix the format.

This PR converts 4 validators from fail-open to fail-closed and adds 1
new content-aware validator (matrix-evidence-link). The pattern can be
extended to other validators showing similar silent-pass behavior.

## v2.44.0 — verdict-aware Next + review.method axis + agents + test-id stack (PR #67)

Bundles 5 reporter-internal milestones (v2.43.1 → v2.43.5) into a single minor release: 1612 insertions, 83 deletions, 18 files. Built on top of v2.43.2's i18n login fix.

### Added — `/vg:review` step 0a 4th axis: **Method** (v2.43.4)

3-axis prompt (env/mode/scanner) → 4-axis prompt (env/mode/scanner/**method**). Method values: `spawn` (Task tool internal) / `manual` (paste prompt) / `hybrid` (mix). Symmetry with `roam.mode` (self/spawn/manual). Smart coercion: `scanner=haiku-only` → coerce method=spawn (Haiku only available via Task tool internal).

### Fixed — verdict-aware `/vg:next` routing (kills accept-on-gaps loop, v2.43.2)

Pre-fix: `/vg:test` verdict=GAPS_FOUND → display always said "Next: /vg:accept" → user runs `/vg:accept` → blocked on gaps → loop. Now: case block per verdict (PASSED / GAPS_FOUND / FAILED) with 5–7 labeled options A–G. `/vg:next` exits 1 if asked to auto-route to accept while verdict is non-PASS.

### Added — VG-branded planner agents (v2.43.1)

- `agents/vg-planner.md` + `agents/vg-plan-checker.md` thin-shells with `install.sh` deploy logic.
- Replaces "gsd-planner" / "gsd-plan-checker" green tag with VG-branded equivalents.
- Both fail-loud if calling skill forgot to inject `<vg_*_rules>` block.

### Added — Stable test-IDs stack (v2.43.5)

- `scripts/validators/verify-test-ids-declared.py` — gate that components in PLAN.md have testid declarations.
- `scripts/validators/verify-test-ids-injected.py` — gate that build emitted `data-testid` per declaration.
- `scripts/validators/verify-i18n-vs-testid.py` — gate that codegen never used `getByText('English')` when an i18n-stable testid was available.
- `scripts/retrofit-testids.py` — retrofit tool for already-built phases.
- `templates/vg/test-ids-setup/README.md` — opt-in setup template; `vg.config.template.md` adds 42-line testid block.
- Closes the i18n-fragility class entirely: codegen (v2.43.2 Rule 2.5) was layer 1; this is layer 2 (build-time + verify-time gates).

### Updated — README.md + README.vi.md (v2.43.0/v2.43.1 parity)

- Banner updated to v2.43.x line.
- Pipeline section now shows 9 steps including `[deploy]` + `[roam]`.
- 3 new strength sections.
- 2 reliability stories (PrintwayV3 dogfood arc).
- Command table refreshed.
- Vietnamese parity in README.vi.md.

### Fixed — test.md test-id rule conflict
- Conflict resolved by combining: PR #67's template-testid + telemetry guidance + v2.43.2's Rule 2.5 (login id selectors). Both kept.

### Internal
- 234 tests pass.
- Codex mirror regenerated.
- `VGFLOW-VERSION` + `VERSION` synced to 2.44.0 (minor bump — additive features).
- Credit: external dogfood from @vietnhprintway (PrintwayV3 Phase 3.4b dogfood arc — same week as PRs #57–#66).

## v2.43.2 — `/vg:test` codegen i18n fix (PR #66)

### Fixed
- `commands/vg/test.md` codegen rules — added Rule 2.5: generated Playwright specs MUST use id-based selectors (`#login-email`, `#login-password`) for login, NOT `getByLabel(/password/i)` regex.
- **Why**: `getByLabel(/password/i)` only matches English labels. i18n projects translate FormLabel text (Vietnamese: "Mật khẩu", Spanish: "Contraseña", etc.) and tests fail with `TimeoutError` at password field — login never completes, ALL downstream specs fail.
- Discovery: PrintwayV3 dogfood Phase 3.4b `/vg:test` (2026-04-30) — 5/5 generated specs failed at password fill because project labels are Vietnamese. After switching to id-based helper: 2/5 specs PASSED before API rate limit, 3 remaining only need `.first()` refinement (multi-element strict mode); login itself succeeded.
- This is bug class 6 of 6 critical bugs surfaced during the PrintwayV3 dogfood arc — all share root cause "shipped code without runtime coordination". Credit: external dogfood from @vietnhprintway.

### Internal
- 234 tests pass.
- Codex mirror regenerated.
- Both `VGFLOW-VERSION` and `VERSION` synced to 2.43.2.

## v2.43.1 — `/vg:roam` HARD gates + always-ask + `self` executor mode (PR #65)

Three dogfood-driven fixes layered on v2.43.0's `/vg:roam` skill (reporter's internal milestones v2.42.9 → v2.42.11):

### Fixed (silent-skip closure)
- **runtime_contract telemetry + `.tmp` marker enforcement** — AI cannot silently skip the 0aa resume prompt or the 0a env/model/mode batch. Hard bash assertion at step 1 entry fails fast if markers missing/stale or env vars empty. Closes the silent-skip path that triggered today's PrintwayV3 dogfood incident.

### Fixed (resume-locks-you-in footgun)
- **Step 0a 3-question batch (env/model/mode) now ALWAYS fires regardless of resume mode** — prior config loads as `ROAM_PRIOR_*` pre-fill (Recommended option), but user must confirm. Previously, `--resume` mode silently locked you into the prior session's env/model choices.

### Added — `self` executor mode (v2.42.11)
- **Platform detection** — web / mobile-native / desktop / api-only inferred from `CONTEXT.md` keywords + tool availability (Playwright MCP, maestro, adb, codex, gemini) → `MODES_AVAIL` array filters mode question dynamically.
- **`self` mode** — current Claude Code session is the executor via MCP Playwright. No subprocess, no Chromium permission issues, no CLI auth gymnastics. Validated end-to-end in PrintwayV3 canary: S01 admin/audit-log on sandbox, 3 of 8 protocol steps via `mcp__playwright2`, 4 events emitted, 0 bugs. Login worked, URL state sync honored, API contract honored.

### Internal
- 17/17 bash blocks pass `bash -n` syntax check.
- 234 tests pass.
- Codex mirror regenerated.
- `VGFLOW-VERSION` bumped to 2.43.1 to match `VERSION` (reporter's PR only updated the secondary file; canonical is `VGFLOW-VERSION`, used by `install.sh` + `vg_update.py`).
- Credit: external dogfood from @vietnhprintway (PrintwayV3, same arc as PRs #57–#64).

## v2.43.0 — `/vg:roam` + `/vg:deploy` + scope step 1b env preference (PR #64)

Bundles five reporter-internal milestones (v2.42.4 → v2.42.8) into a single minor release. Pure addition — 2367 insertions, 0 deletions. All built on top of v2.42.0's HARD env+mode+scanner gate and #63's `enrich-env-question.py` helper.

### Added — `/vg:roam` (NEW skill, 878 lines)

Exploratory CRUD-lifecycle pass that runs **after** `/vg:test` and **before** `/vg:accept`. Lens-driven brief composer + LLM executor + analyzer chain catches silent state-mismatches and lifecycle gaps that scripted tests miss.

- Step `0aa_resume_check` — 4 modes: fresh / `--force` / `--resume` / `--aggregate-only`. Closes the "không cache thì mỗi lần chạy là chạy mới à?" gap.
- Step `0a_env_mode_gate` — wires `enrich-env-question.py` from #63 (B2 roam wiring); env+mode+scanner gate options decorated with DEPLOY-STATE.json evidence.
- Step `0a_pre_prompt_1` — runtime backfill of `preferred_env_for` for phases scoped before step 1b landed (B4 backfill).
- Real dogfood validated: PrintwayV3 phase 03.4a-team-member-rbac-2fa with local Codex executor — 20 surfaces discovered, 20 INSTRUCTION files generated with verbatim creds, 5 min wall, 43k tokens, 9 JSONL events emitted, R1-R8 detectors processed correctly.
- New helpers: `roam-discover-surfaces.py` (145), `roam-compose-brief.py` (283), `roam-analyze.py` (300), `roam-merge-specs.py` (56).

### Added — `/vg:deploy` (NEW skill, 588 lines)

Standalone multi-env deploy command (sandbox/staging/prod) with prod typed-token confirmation. Writes `deployed.{env}` block to DEPLOY-STATE.json — sha, deployed_at, health, deploy_log path, previous_sha (for rollback), dry_run flag.

DEPLOY-STATE.json now drives env-suggestion across review/test/roam/accept.

### Added — `/vg:scope` step `1b_env_preference` (B3, +117 lines)

5-option preset writes `preferred_env_for` to DEPLOY-STATE.json after scope decisions lock:
- `auto` — heuristic per profile (feature → sandbox; security-critical → staging; emergency → prod)
- `all-sandbox` — every step on sandbox
- `most-common` — review/test on sandbox, roam/accept on staging
- `paranoid` — review/test on sandbox, roam on staging, accept on prod
- `all-local` — fastest iteration

### Pipeline (post-v2.43.0)

```
specs → scope (step 1b sets preferred_env_for)
      → blueprint
      → build
      → [/vg:deploy]                                          ← NEW
      → /vg:review  (env gate decorated by enrich-helper)
      → /vg:test    (same)
      → [/vg:roam]  (same; runtime backfill if pref missing)  ← NEW
      → /vg:accept
```

### Pending follow-up (not in this release)
- Wire `enrich-env-question.py` into `/vg:review` step 0a (B2 review part)
- Wire same into `/vg:test`
- `/vg:rollback` consumer reading `deployed.{env}.previous_sha`
- `/vg:next` routing — recommend `/vg:deploy` when user picks sandbox/staging/prod env at /vg:review without prior deploy

### Internal
- 234 tests pass (pure additive; no regressions in existing flow).
- Codex mirrors regenerated — now 69 skills (2 new: `vg-roam`, `vg-deploy`).
- Credit: external dogfood from @vietnhprintway (PrintwayV3, same arc as #57/#58/#60/#61/#62/#63 → v2.41.4/v2.42.0).

## v2.42.0 — HARD env+mode+scanner gate + 5 dogfood-driven fixes (PRs #58–#63)

External dogfood (@vietnhprintway, PrintwayV3) shipped 7 PRs in 24 hours after v2.41.4 — bundling 1 major review-flow gate change + 4 bug fixes + 2 features. v2.42.0 absorbs all of them.

### Major: HARD env+mode+scanner gate (PR #58)

Closes the silent-default gap on `/vg:review`. Pre-v2.42, review used `config.step_env.verify` silently — phases needed 2-3 review re-runs because env wasn't pinned and PIPELINE-STATE.json never recorded the choice. v2.41.2 added `<MANDATORY_GATE>` narrative; AI agents observably skipped it because the marker contract was `severity: warn`. v2.42.0 makes this a HARD `severity: block` gate with required telemetry event, closing the loophole.

- New step `<step name="0a_env_mode_gate">` with single batched `AskUserQuestion` 3-question payload: env (local/sandbox/staging/prod), mode (full/delta/regression/schema-verify/link-check/infra-smoke), scanner (haiku-only/codex-supplement/gemini-supplement/council-all).
- `must_touch_markers`: `0a_env_mode_gate` (default block severity, waiver `--non-interactive`).
- `must_emit_telemetry`: `review.env_mode_confirmed` required unless `--non-interactive` or all 3 axes on CLI.
- CLI flags: `--target-env=`, `--mode=`, `--scanner=` (and shortcuts `--local`/`--sandbox`/`--staging`/`--prod`).
- PIPELINE-STATE.json audit trail: `steps.review.{env, mode, scanner, profile, last_invoked_at, last_args}`.
- Banner echoes choices at start of `phase1_code_scan` so user sees `--scanner` honored.

### Major: Strict per-phase mockup gate (PR #59)

`/vg:blueprint` previously passed scaffold check whenever ANY shared/legacy manifest existed (e.g. `.vg/design-normalized/manifest.json` from initial Phase 1 design extract). Silent-passed every subsequent phase → builds shipped with AI-imagined UI. Now requires per-phase mockups by default; legitimate cross-phase reuse needs `--allow-shared-mockup-reuse`.

### Fixed (PR #60) — surface-probe heading format tolerance + api endpoint fallback chain

Backend-heavy phase hit `surface-probe.sh` regressions during `/vg:review` Phase 4a — every backend goal classified `NOT_SCANNED`, 4c-pre gate hard-blocked phase even though probes would have validated.

- `_surface_probe_get_goal_block`: matches `^## (Goal )?G-XX[^A-Za-z0-9_]` (optional "Goal " word + em-dash/hyphen). Pre-fix only matched canonical `## Goal G-XX:`; older template files using `## G-XX —` returned empty block → SKIPPED.
- `probe_api`: 3-layer endpoint extraction — strict `METHOD path` → path-only fallback (synthesize `ANY <path>`) → API-CONTRACTS.md cross-reference by goal id. Pre-fix required explicit `POST /api/v1/foo` in criteria bullet; natural prose like "Endpoint /api/v1/credits/grant tạo credit" returned SKIPPED.
- New SKIP message: `SKIPPED|no_endpoint_in_criteria_or_contracts` (only after all 3 layers fail).

### Fixed (PR #61) — orphan-run legacy fallback in read/clear_active_run

`run-status` / `run-complete` symmetry break: bash subshell wrote active run with `sid="unknown"` (no `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` inherited), then Stop hook fired `run-complete` with the real session id and got `⛔ No active run to complete.`. Now `read_active_run` falls back to legacy snapshot when sid mismatches AND the legacy entry has the "unknown" sentinel — Stop hook can clean up orphan runs using the real session id.

### Fixed (PR #62) — zsh wordsplit shim for bash blocks under Claude Code

Claude Code runs bash via `/bin/zsh` on macOS (and Linux when zsh is the user's shell). zsh leaves unquoted `$VAR` unsplit by default — canonical bash patterns like `for a in $REQUIRED; do ...` (whitespace-split string) iterated ONCE with `$a` set to the entire string. 45+ skill bash blocks affected. New `commands/vg/_shared/lib/zsh-compat.sh` enables `setopt SH_WORD_SPLIT` (no-op under bash). Sourced by `block-resolver.sh`, `inject-rule-cards.sh`, `override-debt.sh`, `phase-profile.sh`.

### Feature (PR #63) — `enrich-env-question.py` DEPLOY-STATE-aware option decorator

New helper at `scripts/enrich-env-question.py` (262 lines). Future skill bodies (review/test/roam/accept) call it before their env+mode+scanner `AskUserQuestion` to decorate per-env labels + descriptions with evidence pulled from `${PHASE_DIR}/DEPLOY-STATE.json`. SUGGESTION ONLY — user still picks. 3-signal recommendation (per-phase preference > deploy freshness > profile heuristic).

### Triage
- Closed PR #57 as duplicate of #56 (already in v2.41.4).

### Internal
- 234 tests pass.
- All 6 PRs from external dogfood reporter (@vietnhprintway, PrintwayV3) — same week as #53/#55 reports. Strong signal-to-noise.

### Backward compatibility
- Existing `/vg:review` flags (`--skip-scan`, `--skip-discovery`, `--non-interactive`, etc.) unchanged.
- Phases that already pass all 3 env-mode-scanner axes on CLI (or use `--non-interactive`) skip the prompt — no behavior change for scripted/CI use.
- `--scanner=codex-supplement|gemini-supplement|council-all` records the choice in PIPELINE-STATE.json + emits banner; actual `codex exec` / `gemini` / Claude CLI dispatch wires in v2.42.1 (next iter).

## v2.41.4 — Headed-mode preservation in playwright MCP repair (closes PR #56)

### Fixed
- `verify-playwright-mcp-config.py` `_playwright_entry()` and `_render_codex_sections()` now bake `--no-headless` into the canonical MCP server template for both Claude (`settings.json`) and Codex (`config.toml`). Pre-fix, calling `--repair` (via `/vg:update`, `install.sh`, `sync.sh`) silently stripped any user-added `--no-headless` flag, breaking the documented HEADED-mode contract in `commands/vg/test.md` (lines 564, 650). Result: `/vg:review` Phase 2b Haiku scanners launched invisible browsers — operator couldn't watch the scan progress.

### Internal
- `@playwright/mcp` v0.0.71+ documents `--headless` (default-headed) and `--no-headless` (explicit) as durable flags.
- Existing `test_playwright_mcp_config.py` assertions still pass — `_user_data_dir()` helper locates `--user-data-dir` by name, unaffected by extra flags before it.
- Credit: external dogfood report from @vietnhprintway (PR #56), same reporter as #53 / #55.

## v2.41.3 — `/vg:update` Windows + gate-integrity hotfixes (closes #53, #55)

Bundles four cross-platform `/vg:update` hardening fixes reported by external dogfood (PrintwayV3 on macOS + a Windows install).

### Fixed
- **Issue #53 Bug #1 (CRITICAL)** — `vg_update.py:three_way_merge` now passes `encoding="utf-8"` to `subprocess.run`. Pre-fix, `text=True` defaulted to `locale.getpreferredencoding()` (cp1252 on Windows), which silently mojibake-decoded UTF-8 bytes ≥ 0x80 (`⛔` → `â›"`, `→` → `â†'`, `—` → `â€"`) and re-encoded as UTF-8 — corrupting hundreds of files in a single update run. Reporter measured 373 corrupted files + 134 false-positive conflicts on a v2.27.0 → v2.41.1 update before patching locally.
- **Issue #53 Bug #2 (HIGH)** — `vg_update.py:main()` reconfigures `sys.stdout` / `sys.stderr` to UTF-8 with `errors=replace` when the console default isn't already UTF-8. Pre-fix, `print("⛔ ...")` raised `UnicodeEncodeError` on Windows cp1252 console, breaking caller exit-code logic in `update.md` step 6b. No-op on Linux/macOS.
- **Issue #55 + #53 Bug #3 (MEDIUM, but blocks update flow)** — `_locate_gate_block` now anchors to `<step name="{gate_id}">` directly (gate_id is unique per manifest entry). Pre-fix, the locator used `text.find(fingerprint) + rfind("<step", 0, idx)` heuristic; when the fingerprint substring also appeared inside an unrelated earlier step block (boilerplate like `**Update PIPELINE-STATE.json:**`), it walked back to the wrong step and reported a false-positive `content_hash_mismatch`. Reproducer: `review.md` with both `<step name="0_parse_and_validate">` and `<step name="complete">` sharing common prose. Fingerprint kept as a deprecated fallback for legacy manifests.
- **Issue #53 Bug #4 (LOW but pernicious)** — `reapply-patches.md` patches-mode resolution loop + COUNT/REMAINING captures now pipe Python output through `tr -d '\r'`. Pre-fix on Windows, `python3 -c "print(...)"` emitted `\r\n`; bash `read -r REL` kept the trailing `\r`, so `${PATCHES_DIR}/${REL}\r.conflict` never existed → every entry reported "STALE — conflict file missing", manifest never drained.

### Triage
- Closed #54 (auto-report sig 4a039a9f, empty context block).
- Closed #46 + #40 (auto-reports from v2.31.1 / v2.28.0 — outdated, empty context, no repro).
- Updated #44 (v2.30.0 dogfood checklist superseded by v2.41.x flow).

### Internal
- 234 tests pass.
- `_locate_gate_block` regression test verifies duplicate-fingerprint scenario picks the right step.

### Notes
- No behavior change for healthy installs on Linux/macOS that didn't hit any of these edge cases.
- Windows users who completed a `/vg:update` between v2.40.x and v2.41.2 should run `/vg:update` again on v2.41.3 — the encoding fix only applies to NEW merges; previously corrupted files need to be restored from `.claude/vgflow-ancestor/v{prev}/` (see Issue #53 recovery section).

## v2.41.2 — Phase 2b-2.5 enforcement model fix (regression from v2.40.0)

User report: "/vg:review on another project just runs headless browser and reports bugs — no prompts for recursion / probe-mode / target-env, even after v2.41.1." Cross-AI review traced this to an enforcement-model regression: v2.40.0 introduced Phase 2b-2.5 by **nesting it inside `<step name="phase2_browser_discovery">`** instead of giving it its own step wrapper. v2.39.0 had 24 top-level `<step>` wrappers, each with profile filter + `must_touch_markers` entry + telemetry contract. Phase 2b-2.5 had none of these — orchestrator could (and did) silently skip the entire 142-line block.

### Fixed (root cause: enforcement model)
- `commands/vg/review.md`: split Phase 2b-2.5 into its own `<step name="phase2_5_recursive_lens_probe">` (profile=web-fullstack,web-frontend-only). 2b-3 (collect/merge) split into `<step name="phase2b_collect_merge">`. Both registered in `must_touch_markers` (severity: warn).
- New telemetry contract: `review.recursive_probe.preflight_asked` (required unless --non-interactive) + `review.recursive_probe.eligibility_checked` (always emitted with passed=true|false payload).
- AskUserQuestion pre-flight section now wrapped in `<MANDATORY_GATE>` — orchestrator can no longer lazy-skip.
- Bash anti-forge guard: refuses to launch with bare defaults if all three env vars empty + not in CI mode. Emits `review.recursive_probe.preflight_skipped` block-severity telemetry.

### Fixed (B2: dead lens prompts)
- `scripts/spawn_recursive_probe.py`: workers now actually load the lens markdown body from `commands/vg/_shared/lens-prompts/lens-*.md` (mirrors `spawn-crud-roundtrip.py:load_kit_prompt` pattern). Pre-v2.41.2 the 16 lens prompts sat unused on disk while workers received a 3-line generic prompt — explains why run artifacts came back empty.
- Placeholder substitution: `${VIEW_PATH}`, `${SELECTOR}`, `${ROLE}`, `${TOKEN_REF}`, `${PEER_TOKEN_REF}`, `${BASE_URL}`, `${OUTPUT_PATH}`, `${ACTION_BUDGET}`, etc. resolved before subprocess spawn. Unknown placeholders left as `${VAR}` literal (workers can detect missing context).
- Auth context loaded: `tokens.local.yaml` + `vg.config.md base_url:` injected into context block + lens body.

### Fixed (B3: silent eligibility skip)
- `scripts/spawn_recursive_probe.py:check_eligibility`: skip path now writes a stderr banner with per-rule actionable hints (e.g. "set `phase_profile: feature` in `.phase-profile`"), emits `review.recursive_probe.skipped` telemetry, and points at the `.recursive-probe-skipped.yaml` audit file. Pre-v2.41.2 the skip went silently to stdout mixed with Haiku scanner log → operators thought 2b-2.5 ran when it had failed eligibility silently.

### Internal
- `codex-skills/vg-review/SKILL.md` re-mirrored with new step boundaries + contract entries.
- 234 tests pass.

### Migration note for existing projects
Run `/vg:update` then `/vg:reapply-patches` (if you have local edits to `review.md`). The next `/vg:review` will show three AskUserQuestion prompts before browser probes start.

## v2.41.1 — Phase 2b-2.5 interactive prompt fix (orchestrator-layer)

### Fixed (UX, regression from v2.40.0)
- `/vg:review` under Claude Code now actually prompts for `--recursion`, `--probe-mode`, `--target-env` when the operator omits them.
  - **Root cause:** Claude Code's bash sandbox makes `sys.stdin.isatty()` return `False`, so the script-side `input()` prompts in `spawn_recursive_probe.py` silently fell back to defaults (`light` / `auto` / `sandbox`). Additionally, the bash block hard-coded `RECURSION_MODE="${RECURSION_MODE:-light}"` and `PROBE_MODE="${PROBE_MODE:-auto}"`, so even when the script's TTY check would have fired, the env vars were always pre-set → script defaults won.
  - **Fix:** Phase 2b-2.5 now uses `AskUserQuestion` at the command (review.md) layer, which Claude Code surfaces natively. Bash forwards each axis only when set; argparse defaults apply otherwise. `VG_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` still suppresses prompts for CI.

### Internal
- `commands/vg/review.md` — new "Pre-flight (v2.41.1) — operator config via AskUserQuestion" section before the bash invocation
- Bash block restructured to forward `--mode` / `--probe-mode` / `--target-env` only when corresponding env var is set
- `codex-skills/vg-review/SKILL.md` re-mirrored for parity gate

### Notes
- No behavior change for non-interactive callers (CI, `--non-interactive`, piped runs) — they continue to use script defaults.
- No behavior change for terminal-direct callers (running `python scripts/spawn_recursive_probe.py` outside Claude Code) — script-side TTY prompt still works as fallback.

## v2.41.0 — Backlog Closure (Tier-2 wiring + Telemetry + Hybrid mode)

### Added
- Tier-2 element classifier wiring (5 previously-unreachable lenses now active: open-redirect, ssrf, auth-jwt, business-logic, info-disclosure)
- Hybrid probe-mode actual implementation per `vg.config.md review.recursive_probe.hybrid_routing`
- Telemetry emissions: `recursion.state_hash_hit`, `recursion.mutation_budget_exhausted`

### Fixed
- `/vg:review-batch` production entry point — multi-fallback resolution (VG_REVIEW_CMD env > claude CLI > python -m vg.review > hard-fail)
- Hybrid mode no longer hard-fails — actual per-lens routing implemented

### Internal
- `scripts/identify_interesting_clickables.py` — 6 Tier-2 detectors (replaces stubs from v2.40.0)
- `scripts/_telemetry_helpers.py` — append-only `.vg/telemetry.jsonl` event emitter
- 30 new tests across Tier-2, telemetry, hybrid mode

### Closes
- v2.40 backlog #1 (review_batch entry), #2 (Tier-2 wiring), #4 (telemetry), #5 (hybrid impl)

### Still deferred
- #3 Real LLM dogfood (needs user-supplied phase fixture + GEMINI_API_KEY)
- #6 Codex GPT-5 xhigh re-review (user-driven; prompt parked)

## v2.40.2 — Manual mode per-tool subdirs + minor fixes

### Fixed (UX)
- Manual mode now generates per-tool prompt subdirs (`recursive-prompts/{codex,gemini}/`) — user picks which CLI to paste into without conflicts
- Per-tool output subdirs (`runs/{codex,gemini}/`) — artifacts isolated, no overwrite when running both tools on same phase
- Per-probe paste file shortened ~15 lines (refs lens file by path instead of inlining full text) — easier copy-paste UX
- Tool-specific token env: `GEMINI_PROBE_TOKEN` for gemini, `CODEX_PROBE_TOKEN` for codex

### Fixed (correctness)
- Hybrid mode now hard-fails with clear v2.41 deferred message (was silently falling back to auto, hiding limitation from user)

### Fixed (docs)
- Plan docs updated 14→16 lenses (cosmetic drift from Task 17 reality check)

### Added flags
- `scripts/generate_recursive_prompts.py --tools="gemini,codex"` (default both, single tool OK)
- `scripts/verify_manual_run_artifacts.py --tool={gemini,codex,both}` (default both)

## v2.40.1 — Interactive target_env prompt

### Added
- Interactive target_env selection at Phase 2b-2.5 when `--target-env` flag NOT provided AND `--non-interactive` NOT set
- Prod confirmation: typing exact phase name required to prevent accidental prod targeting (analog to GitHub repo deletion safety)

### UX improvement
Before: user had to remember/type `--target-env=sandbox` every review.
After: VG prompts on each interactive review with 4 clear options + safety confirmation for prod.

### Files
- Modified: scripts/spawn_recursive_probe.py (+~80 LOC — `prompt_target_env`, `confirm_prod_target`, `_config_has_explicit_target_env`, main() wiring)
- Modified: commands/vg/review.md (Phase 2b-2.5 invocation: `--target-env` only forwarded when caller pinned it)
- Added: tests/test_spawn_recursive_probe_target_env_prompt.py (8 tests)

## v2.40.0 — Recursive Lens Probe + Multi-Phase Batch + Sandbox Env

### Added
- Phase 2b-2.5 recursive lens probe layer in `/vg:review` — exploratory deep-scan style (Strix-spider, NOT scripted), 16 bug-class lenses
- 14+2 lens prompts in `commands/vg/_shared/lens-prompts/` covering authz, injection, auth, bizlogic, server-side, ui-mechanic, redirect bug classes
- Phase 0 diagnostic gate — `--debug` flag + base_url multi-location resolver + fail-fast guard + crud-roundtrip kit imperative preamble
- 6-rule eligibility check with auto-skip + override (`--skip-recursive-probe="<reason>"` logs OVERRIDE-DEBT critical)
- 3 probe modes: `auto` (subprocess workers), `manual` (paste prompts in CLI), `hybrid` (split per lens config)
- Interactive prompt at Phase 2b-2.5 (with `--non-interactive` for CI)
- `/vg:review-batch` for multi-phase deep-scan (sequential, aggregates BATCH-FINDINGS-{date}.json)
- Target environment policy: `--target-env={local,sandbox,staging,prod}` with prod read-only safeguard via `--i-know-this-is-prod="<reason>"`
- Per-tool subdir isolation: `runs/{gemini,codex,claude}/recursive-*.json`
- Goal back-flow with canonical-key dedupe: light=50, deep=150, exhaustive=400 caps + recursive-goals-overflow.json
- Mode caps: light/deep/exhaustive (depth 2/3/4, workers ~15/40/100)
- Probe-only contract: workers report facts, no severity/fix/exploit reasoning (delegated to derive-findings.py downstream)

### Fixed
- Phase 0 production bug: base_url silently null when REPO_ROOT/.claude/vg.config.md missing → workers got null URL (H1, commit `2292dc7`)
- Phase 0 production bug: kit prompt advertised legacy field names (route_list/create) but context_block nests under platforms_web.list.route → ambiguous prompt (H3, commit `0323ba0`)
- Auth token leak in --debug log via cmd[:5] slice (commit `28e51c9`) — security fix

### New configs (vg.config.md)
- `review.recursive_probe.{default_mode,default_probe_mode,worker_concurrency,max_depth_overrides,activation_profiles,activation_surfaces,hybrid_routing}`
- `review.target_env: "sandbox"` (default)
- `review.prod_safety.require_reason_flag: true`
- `review.batch.{parallelism,continue_on_phase_fail}`

### New commands
- `/vg:review --recursion={light,deep,exhaustive} --probe-mode={auto,manual,hybrid} --target-env={local,sandbox,staging,prod}`
- `/vg:review-batch --phases <p1,p2,...>` OR `--milestone <M>` OR `--since <git-sha>`

### New scripts
- `scripts/spawn_recursive_probe.py` — manager dispatcher (eligibility + lens map + worker spawn)
- `scripts/generate_recursive_prompts.py` — manual mode template renderer
- `scripts/verify_manual_run_artifacts.py` — BLOCK validator post-manual-paste
- `scripts/identify_interesting_clickables.py` — Tier-1 element classifier
- `scripts/aggregate_recursive_goals.py` — single-writer goal dedupe + overflow
- `scripts/canonicalize_url.py` — URL state-hash memoization
- `scripts/env_policy.py` — per-env constraints (local/sandbox/staging/prod)
- `scripts/review_batch.py` — multi-phase orchestrator

### Internal
- 16 lens prompt files + _TEMPLATE.md + README.md in `commands/vg/_shared/lens-prompts/`
- Manual mode templates in `commands/vg/_shared/templates/MANUAL-PROBE-{MANIFEST,PER-LENS}.tmpl`
- 100+ new tests across 18+ test files
- Pre-existing v2.39 pipeline (findings-broker, derive-findings, replay-finding, route-findings-to-build, challenge-coverage) reused without modification

### Closes
- #50 (review không dò thông minh — recursive layer + 16 bug-class lenses + exploratory style)

### Deferred to v2.41+
- Tier-2 element classifier wiring (currently 5 lenses unreachable: open-redirect, ssrf, auth-jwt, business-logic, info-disclosure)
- State hash actual implementation (test scaffold present, telemetry emit deferred)
- Mutation budget telemetry emission (test scaffold present)
- Hybrid mode per-lens router (currently falls back to auto)
- Real LLM dogfood (mocked in test suite — see `docs/plans/2026-04-30-v2.40-dogfood-deferred.md`)
- Codex GPT-5 xhigh re-review (open question #2 in design doc)

## v2.39.0 (2026-04-30) — Charter-violation closer (Codex review v2.38)

After v2.34→v2.38 arc, asked Codex GPT-5 for adversarial review against VG's specific charter (contract-driven white-box, NOT Strix-style black-box pentest). Verdict was sharp: **"not adequate for first dogfood yet — risk of artifact-driven theater"**. 7 charter violations identified.

This release closes the top 5. No new transition kits — Codex prescribed dogfood-driven hardening only.

### Codex critique #1 — Contract validity not gated → `verify-contract-completeness.py`

Charter says contract-driven, but CRUD-SURFACES.md was treated as ground truth without proof it reflects the actual app domain. If planner missed a sensitive resource, every downstream review passes while reviewing the wrong system.

NEW `scripts/verify-contract-completeness.py` diffs runtime/code inventory against declared resources:
- HTTP routes from `routes-static.json` (v2.35) not mapped to any declared resource → flagged
- DB model class names (Mongoose / SQLAlchemy / Prisma / Django / TypeORM) not in contract → flagged
- Background job patterns (BullMQ Queue, Celery task, cron schedule, agenda) → flagged for explicit declaration
- Webhook handlers (`/webhooks/*`, `/callbacks/*`) → flagged

Wired into `review.md` as new Phase 2c-pre (before worker dispatch — saves token cost when contract obviously incomplete).

### Codex critique #6 — No env contract → `ENV-CONTRACT.md` + preflight gate

Workers spawn against environments with implicit state. Empty seed data → empty list views render gracefully → review passes. Tokens valid but for wrong tenant. Mutations succeed but third-party callbacks live-fired into prod.

NEW required artifact `commands/vg/_shared/templates/ENV-CONTRACT-template.md` declares:
- `target.base_url` + health endpoint
- `seed_users` (with stable user_id + tenant_id for cross-resource auth tests)
- `seed_data` expectations (count_min per resource, must_include_states)
- `feature_flags` expected ON/OFF
- `third_party_stubs` (stripe/sendgrid/s3 mode: stubbed | live | not_used)
- `runtime_state` (migrations applied, search indexes, message queues)
- `preflight_checks[]` — concrete probes verified before workers spawn
- `out_of_scope[]` — explicit exclusions

NEW `scripts/verify-env-contract.py` runs preflight probes pre-spawn. Mandatory for kits crud-roundtrip / approval-flow / bulk-action. Optional for static-sast (no UI runtime).

Override path: `--skip-env-contract="<reason>"` logs OVERRIDE-DEBT critical entry.

### Codex critique #5 — Artifacts pass without reproducibility → replay manifest + `replay-finding.py`

Findings could pass review but couldn't be re-executed during human triage. First dogfood findings would be disputed or impossible to rerun.

UPDATED `crud-roundtrip.md` kit prompt — every finding now MUST include `replay` block:

```json
"replay": {
  "commit_sha": "...",
  "worker_prompt_version": "crud-roundtrip.md@<mtime>",
  "env": {"base_url": "...", "phase_dir": "..."},
  "fixtures_used": {"role": "...", "user_id": "...", "tenant_id": "..."},
  "seed_payload_pattern": "vg-review-{run_id}-create",
  "request_sequence": [{"step": "...", "method": "...", "url": "...", "headers": {}, "body": {}, "expected_status": 201, "observed_status": 201, "response_excerpt": "..."}]
}
```

NEW `scripts/replay-finding.py --finding-id F-001` re-executes the recorded request sequence with fresh tokens (substitutes `${TOKEN}` from `tokens.local.yaml`) and reports REPRODUCES vs DOES_NOT_REPRODUCE. Detects commit drift between recording and replay.

### Codex critique #3 — Auth model too role-table-shaped → object-level steps

"admin/user" matrices miss ownership / tenancy / record state / delegation. PrintwayV3 will likely break here.

UPDATED `crud-roundtrip.md` kit with 4 mandatory steps for `scope: owner-only` / `tenant-scoped` resources:

- **Step 9** — Cross-owner read (IDOR): user_b GETs entity owned by user_a → expect 403/404
- **Step 10** — Cross-tenant read (tenant leakage): user_other_tenant GETs entity → expect 403/404 (THE worst bug class for multi-tenant SaaS)
- **Step 11** — Cross-owner mutation (privilege escalation): user_b PATCH/DELETEs user_a's entity → expect 403/404. Also checks audit log captures correct actor.
- **Step 12** — State-locked operation: mutate entity in `published`/`archived` state → expect 403/409 if state declared read-only

UPDATED `CRUD-SURFACES-template.md` schema — new `expected_behavior.object_level` block declares per-scope expected behavior. UPDATED `spawn-crud-roundtrip.py` injects `lifecycle_states` + `object_level_auth` into worker context.

### Codex critique #7 — Manager synthesis under-specified → `challenge-coverage.py`

Many workers, but no adversarial reducer challenging worker claims. Workers can mark step-3 (read-after-create) PASS because something new appeared in list, without proving it's the just-created entity with submitted values.

NEW `scripts/challenge-coverage.py` — heuristic challenger:
- Samples 25% of run artifacts (configurable)
- Per pass step: requires non-empty `evidence_ref` AND non-empty `observed` block
- Cross-checks observed status numerically against expected status — mismatch → flagged `false-pass`
- Empty evidence/observed → downgraded to `weak-pass`
- Output: `COVERAGE-CHALLENGE.json` + per-run verdict (STRONG / WEAK / DEGRADED)

Wired into `review.md` as Phase 2e-post (after findings derive, before auto-fix routing).

v2.40 may extend with LLM-driven challenge for ambiguous claims (cheap Sonnet pass).

### Charter compliance — what this DOESN'T fix

Codex critiques #2 (negative-space verification beyond routes) and #4 (data lifecycle coverage: audit logs, soft deletes, orphan files, background job side effects) are partially addressed:

- #2: contract completeness checks routes + DB models + jobs + webhooks. Does NOT yet check: feature-flag-gated paths, server-rendered SSR routes, GraphQL schema, gRPC services.
- #4: object-level Step 9-12 catch some side-effect classes (audit log actor mismatch, state lock). Does NOT yet check: orphan file cleanup, search index invalidation, billing counter drift, queue consumer lag.

These are **opt-in v2.40+** territory — first dogfood data on PrintwayV3 should drive priority.

### Files

- **NEW** `scripts/verify-contract-completeness.py`
- **NEW** `scripts/verify-env-contract.py`

### Sequence

- v2.34–v2.38: 5-release "review hời hợt" arc (closes #49, #50, #51, #52)
- **v2.39.0 (this)**: Codex charter-violation closer (5 of 7 critiques addressed)
- v2.40+: dogfood-driven (negative-space verification, data lifecycle, LLM-challenge)

This release puts review at "ready for first dogfood on PrintwayV3" per Codex's verdict criteria.

## v2.38.1 (2026-04-30) — fix changelog preview + GH release notes auto-extract

User reported on a different machine running `/vg:update`:

> "CHANGELOG không có entry giữa v2.31.1 → v2.38.0 (chắc CHANGELOG.md chưa cập nhật trên main branch). Release notes chỉ ghi 'Automated release. Gate-manifest published for /vg:update T8 integrity verification.'"

Two converging bugs:

### 1. `commands/vg/update.md:146` regex format mismatch

`/vg:update` step 3 (changelog preview) used regex:

```python
re.compile(r'## \[(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\].*?(?=## \[|\Z)', re.S)
```

Expected `## [2.38.0]` (Keep-a-Changelog bracketed format), but VG's CHANGELOG uses `## v2.38.0 (date) — title` (no brackets, leading `v`). Regex never matched → preview always printed `(no changelog entries between versions)`.

**Fix:** updated regex to support both formats:

```python
re.compile(
    r'^## (?:\[)?v?(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)(?:\])?[^\n]*\n.*?(?=^## (?:\[)?v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+|\Z)',
    re.S | re.M,
)
```

Smoke verified: 8 entries (v2.32.0, 2.32.1, 2.33.0, 2.34.0, 2.35.0, 2.36.0, 2.37.0, 2.38.0) all matched against current CHANGELOG.md.

### 2. `.github/workflows/release.yml` hardcoded notes placeholder

The release workflow used a static `--notes "Automated release. See CHANGELOG..."` string for every release. CHANGELOG section was never extracted into the GitHub UI release notes body.

**Fix:** new "Extract CHANGELOG section for release notes" step parses `CHANGELOG.md` for the section matching the version tag and feeds it via `--notes-file release-notes.md`. The footer line ("Gate-manifest published for /vg:update T8 integrity verification.") is appended below the changelog body.

Also: existing-release path now calls `gh release edit --notes-file` to update notes if the workflow is re-run on an existing tag.

### 3. Backfilled release notes for v2.32.0 → v2.38.0

8 releases had the placeholder notes shipped before this fix. Manual backfill via `gh release edit --notes-file` ran today; user can refresh GH page to see proper changelog content for each release. Going forward, releases use auto-extract via the workflow change.

### Files

- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/update.md` — line 146 regex fixed
- **MODIFIED** `.github/workflows/release.yml` — new notes-extract step + edit existing notes path

### Self-bootstrap awareness

This is exactly the kind of bug v2.29.0's update self-bootstrap (#42) was designed for. Users on stale `/vg:update` get the broken regex behavior on the FIRST update run after this fix lands, but `commands/vg/update.md` ships in the tarball; subsequent runs use the fixed regex.

---

## v2.38.0 (2026-04-30) — Flow compliance auditor (per-step verifier)

User feedback: with override flags like `--skip-discovery`, `--evaluate-only`, `--retry-failed`, AI can silently bypass required steps in any flow. The verdict gate (v2.35) catches missing artifact content, but it doesn't catch "AI ran a degraded path that produces *some* artifacts but skipped critical steps".

This release adds an end-of-flow auditor: after every `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:build`, `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:accept`, verify that the AI executed all required evidence-producing steps for the phase profile.

### How it works (evidence-based, not marker-based)

VG's existing `.step-markers/{step}.done` mechanism has inconsistent naming across commands. v2.38 uses **artifact evidence** instead — file presence proves a step ran:

| Step semantically | Evidence file pattern |
|---|---|
| `phase1_code_scan` | (no required evidence — internal state) |
| `phase2_browser_discovery` | `nav-discovery.json` + `scan-*.json` |
| `phase2c_enrich` | `TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md` (optional v2.34) |
| `phase2d_crud_dispatch` | `runs/INDEX.json` (optional v2.35) |
| `phase2e_findings` | `REVIEW-FINDINGS.json` (optional v2.35) |
| `phase4_goal_comparison` | `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md` |
| `build_executor` | `SUMMARY.md` |
| `test_codegen` | `SANDBOX-TEST.md`, `GENERATED_TESTS_DIR/*.spec.ts` |
| `accept_uat` | `UAT.md` |

Each (command × phase profile) pair declares `evidence_required` (must exist) and `evidence_optional` (don't fail if missing) in `commands/vg/_shared/templates/FLOW-COMPLIANCE.yaml`.

### Profile-aware

Phase profile detected from `SPECS.md` frontmatter (`phase_profile: feature|infra|hotfix|bugfix|migration|docs|feature-legacy`) or `vg.config.md → default_profile`.

Different profiles → different required evidence:

```yaml
review:
  feature:
    evidence_required:
      - nav-discovery.json
      - scan-*.json
      - GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md
  feature-legacy:
    evidence_required:
      - GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md     # no browser scan required
  infra:
    evidence_required:
      - SUMMARY.md                   # phaseP_infra_smoke writes here
  docs:
    evidence_required:
      - SUMMARY.md                   # phaseP_link_check writes here
```

### Override path (consistent with rest of pipeline)

Flag `--skip-compliance="<reason>"` logs OVERRIDE-DEBT critical entry, allows flow to proceed. Reviewer must triage at next `/vg:accept`.

### Aggregated at accept

`/vg:accept` runs `verify-flow-compliance.py --command accept` which:
1. Audits accept's own evidence (`UAT.md`)
2. Aggregates `.flow-compliance-{blueprint,build,review,test}.yaml` from prior flows
3. Reports any flow that ran non-compliant without override
4. BLOCK if cross-flow compliance failed (or WARN per config)

This is the cross-flow gate: bắt patterns where AI bypassed required steps anywhere in pipeline, surfaced at accept time.

### Severity ramp

v2.38 ships with `severity: warn` default for dogfood. Promote to `block` via `vg.config.md → flow_compliance.severity: "block"` after observing real-world false-positive rate.

### Files

- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/templates/FLOW-COMPLIANCE.yaml` — profile × command × evidence matrix
- **NEW** `scripts/verify-flow-compliance.py` — auditor script
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/build.md` — post-flow compliance check before run-complete
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/review.md` — same
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/test.md` — same
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/accept.md` — aggregate cross-flow check before mark-step accept
- **MODIFIED** `vg.config.template.md` — `flow_compliance: { enabled, severity, template_path }` block

### Smoke verified

- Phase missing required evidence → exit 1 with concrete missing list
- Same with `--skip-compliance="<reason>"` → exit 0 with WARN logged
- Phase with all required → exit 0 COMPLIANT

### Sequence — arc + post-arc complete

- v2.34 — review→test back-flow (#52)
- v2.35 — CRUD round-trip + scanner invariants (#50, #51)
- v2.36 — TEST-GOALS expansion + 2 kits (#49)
- v2.37 — auto-fix loop + code-only SAST + inter-worker broker
- **v2.38 (this)** — flow compliance auditor (post-arc gap closer)

This closes the last category of "AI bypass step" risk. The remaining 20% gap to Strix parity (specialized vuln skills, external recon tools, OAST) is opt-in expansion territory, not architectural.

---

## v2.37.0 (2026-04-30) — Auto-fix loop + code-only SAST + inter-worker broker

Final piece of the 4-release "review hời hợt" remediation arc. Closes the remaining gaps from the v2.35 Codex review:

- **Auto-fix feedback loop** — review findings can flow into `/vg:build` as remediation tasks (opt-in)
- **Code-only review path** — phases without UI runtime (backend-only, CLI, library) get static SAST kit
- **Inter-worker context sharing** — Strix's "real-time finding broadcast" pattern for parallel CRUD round-trip workers

### W1 — Auto-fix loop

`scripts/route-findings-to-build.py` reads `REVIEW-FINDINGS.json` (v2.35) and emits `AUTO-FIX-TASKS.md` with /vg:build-consumable task entries. Conservative gate per Codex feedback:

- Severity ≥ high
- Confidence == high
- cleanup_status == completed (data integrity)
- Group by dedupe_key (1 fix can address N occurrences)

Wired into `commands/vg/review.md` as new Phase 2f after findings derivation. Opt-in: `/vg:build {phase} --include-auto-fix` consumes (default off in v2.37; may flip to default-on in v2.38 after dogfood).

Each task entry includes:
- Severity, confidence, security_impact, CWE
- Affected resources × roles
- Dedupe key + occurrence count
- Remediation steps (from finding)
- Repro preconditions
- Source finding IDs
- /vg:build instructions for the executor

### W2 — Code-only SAST kit

`commands/vg/_shared/transition-kits/static-sast.md` — third transition kit, for phases without UI runtime. LLM-driven static analysis: triages SAST candidates (semgrep or fallback), traces data flow, emits findings with `data_flow` field replacing `poc_script_code` (no PoC for static).

`scripts/static-sast-runner.py` — SAST candidate generator. Two modes:
- `semgrep` present → `semgrep --config=auto`
- `semgrep` missing → fallback regex patterns for 8 bug classes:
  - `injection` (SQLi/NoSQLi/cmd)
  - `secrets` (hardcoded keys/tokens/JWT secrets)
  - `broken-auth` (route without middleware)
  - `idor` (object query without scope check)
  - `unsafe-deserialize` (pickle/yaml/eval)
  - `mass-assignment` (`...req.body` spread)
  - `path-traversal` (fs ops with user input)
  - `crypto-weak` (MD5/SHA1 for auth, AES-ECB)

Smoke-tested: 7 detections across 5 bug classes from a 14-line vulnerable JS fixture (SQL concat + JWT secret + admin route + IDOR + pickle.loads).

### W3 — Inter-worker findings broker

`scripts/findings-broker.py` — polls `runs/` during dispatch, broadcasts critical findings to in-flight workers via `runs/.broker-context.json`. Workers MAY check this file at step boundaries.

Default broadcast triggers (Strix-inspired):
- `auth_bypass_critical` — severity=critical + security_impact=auth_bypass
- `tenant_leakage_critical` — severity=critical + security_impact=tenant_leakage
- `credential_in_response` — token/secret/api_key in finding's response evidence

Each broadcast includes `actionable_for_other_workers[]` — concrete suggestions like "if you're testing the same role, try other admin routes — the bypass may be middleware-wide" or "inspect your responses for token leakage".

Two modes:
- Snapshot (`--phase-dir <path>`) — one-shot scan + write
- Daemon (`--daemon --interval 5`) — alongside `spawn-crud-roundtrip.py`, polls until INDEX.json shows complete

### Files

- **NEW** `scripts/route-findings-to-build.py`
- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/transition-kits/static-sast.md`
- **NEW** `scripts/static-sast-runner.py`
- **NEW** `scripts/findings-broker.py`
- **MODIFY** `commands/vg/review.md` — Phase 2f (route auto-fix)

### Sequence — arc complete

Per discussion 2026-04-30, this completes the 4-release remediation:

- v2.34.0 — review→test back-flow (closes #52)
- v2.35.0 — CRUD round-trip + scanner invariants (closes #50, #51)
- v2.36.0 — TEST-GOALS expansion + 2 kits (closes #49)
- **v2.37.0 (this)** — auto-fix loop + code-only SAST + inter-worker broker

All 4 issues opened on the "review hời hợt" pattern (#49, #50, #51, #52) are now closed. Arc summary:

| Layer | Before arc | After arc |
|---|---|---|
| Goal layer | ~67 manual high-level | 60-100 manual + 200-400 expanded + 50-150 discovered = **3-source coverage** |
| Worker tier | Haiku 4.5 ($1/M) | Gemini Flash ($0.075/M) — **13× cheaper** |
| Discovery | sidebar-bound 1-role | 3-role auth-aware + iterative re-discovery + static route extractor |
| Verdict gate | path-existence check | 3 content invariants — AI cannot bypass with empty artifacts |
| Findings | none | Strix-style with PoC, dedupe, confidence, repro_preconditions |
| Bug → fix | manual triage | opt-in auto-route via AUTO-FIX-TASKS.md |
| Code-only phases | Haiku navigator (broken) | static-sast kit + semgrep wrapper |
| Cross-worker context | none | broker broadcasts critical findings |

## v2.36.0 (2026-04-30) — TEST-GOALS expansion + 2 transition kits (closes #49)

Continues v2.35.0's CRUD round-trip foundation. Closes the planner-time gap where blueprint declared 67 high-level goals while CRUD-SURFACES.md specified 200-300 verification points. Adds 2 more transition kits per Codex review feedback ("CRUD round-trip is a good primitive for simple admin surfaces, not a universal review primitive").

### Closes #49 — blueprint expand TEST-GOALS from CRUD-SURFACES

- **NEW** `scripts/expand-test-goals-from-crud-surfaces.py` — reads CRUD-SURFACES.md, enumerates per-resource × per-operation × per-role × per-variant (filter / sort / pagination / state / row_action / bulk_action), dedupes against existing TEST-GOALS.md + TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md, emits `TEST-GOALS-EXPANDED.md` with `G-CRUD-*` IDs.
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/blueprint.md` — new sub-step `2b5d_expand_from_crud_surfaces` after TEST-GOALS + CRUD-SURFACES generation.
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/test.md` — sub-step `5d-auto` now reads BOTH `TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md` (runtime, v2.34) AND `TEST-GOALS-EXPANDED.md` (planner, this release).
- **MODIFIED** `scripts/codegen-auto-goals.py` — accepts both `G-AUTO-*` and `G-CRUD-*` prefixes.

### 3-source goal layer (complete)

```
TEST-GOALS.md            ← manual high-level (blueprint primary, ~60-100 goals)
TEST-GOALS-EXPANDED.md   ← planner expansion from CRUD-SURFACES (~200-400 goals)  [NEW v2.36]
TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md ← runtime UI scan emit (~50-150 goals)                   [v2.34]
```

Smoke test: 1 resource × 5 ops × 2 roles × 4 filters/sorts × 4 states × 3 row-actions × 1 bulk-action → **36 expansion goals** from a single resource. Realistic phase (10 resources): 200-400 expansion goals matching Codex's predicted verification surface.

### Goal categories emitted

| Variant | Stub format | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Operation × role | `G-CRUD-{resource}-{op}-{role}` | critical (mutation) / important (read) |
| Filter | `G-CRUD-{resource}-list-{role}-filter-{name}` | important |
| Sort column | `G-CRUD-{resource}-list-{role}-sort-{column}` | important |
| Pagination | `G-CRUD-{resource}-list-{role}-paging` | important |
| State (loading/empty/error/zero_result/unauthorized) | `G-CRUD-{resource}-list-{role}-state-{name}` | nice-to-have / important |
| Row action | `G-CRUD-{resource}-row-{role}-{action}` | important |
| Bulk action | `G-CRUD-{resource}-bulk-{role}-{action}` | important |

Each stub has `expected_status` derived from CRUD-SURFACES `expected_behavior[role][op]` matrix — not a global naive role matrix (Codex critique #4 fix).

### 2 more transition kits (Codex critique #1 fix)

CRUD round-trip alone misses approval workflows, bulk operations, settings toggles, async jobs. v2.36 ships:

- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/transition-kits/approval-flow.md` — 8-step lifecycle test for resources with pending → approved/rejected state machine. Tests separation-of-duties (requester cannot approve own request), audit log emit on state transition, idempotency on re-approve, invalid transitions (reject → approve).
- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/transition-kits/bulk-action.md` — 8-step multi-select + batch test. Tests partial-failure handling (5 succeed / 2 fail), batch limit enforcement (DoS), unauthorized role bulk-mutate bypass, race-condition probe (rows changing during op).

Resources opt-in via `kit:` field in CRUD-SURFACES.md:

```yaml
resources:
  - name: topup_requests
    kit: approval-flow              # was crud-roundtrip
    requester_role: user
    approver_role: admin
    lifecycle_states: [pending, approved, rejected]
```

### Token cost (estimated per phase)

- Blueprint expansion: ~$0.00 (deterministic Python script, no LLM)
- Worker dispatch (Gemini Flash): same as v2.35 (~$0.045 per 30 round-trip workflows)
- Codegen 5d-auto: same as v2.34 (template-based, no LLM)

Net: same cost as v2.35, **3-5× more goal coverage**.

### Files

- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/transition-kits/approval-flow.md`
- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/transition-kits/bulk-action.md`
- **NEW** `scripts/expand-test-goals-from-crud-surfaces.py`
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/blueprint.md` (+1 sub-step)
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/test.md` (5d-auto reads both sources)
- **MODIFIED** `scripts/codegen-auto-goals.py` (accepts G-CRUD-* prefix)

### Sequence note

This is fix 3 of 4 for the systemic *"review hời hợt"* pattern:

- v2.34.0 (shipped) — review→test back-flow (closes #52)
- v2.35.0 (shipped) — CRUD round-trip + scanner invariants (closes #50, #51)
- **v2.36.0 (this)** — TEST-GOALS expansion + approval-flow + bulk-action (closes #49)
- v2.37.0 — auto-fix loop + code-only SAST kit + inter-worker findings broker

---

## v2.35.0 (2026-04-30) — CRUD round-trip review (closes #50, #51)

User feedback: review pipeline is "hời hợt" — prescribed exhaustive scan, target wrong roles, wastes tokens, fails to find real bugs. CRUD operations are not independent lenses; they're a chained workflow with Read interleaved between mutations to verify persistence.

This release reshapes review's bug-finding strategy around two ideas borrowed from `usestrix/strix`:

1. **Skills are prompts, not code** — the kit prompt `crud-roundtrip.md` teaches an LLM how to find bugs in a CRUD resource. No prescribed click-everything workflow.
2. **Run artifacts, not findings-only** — workers emit `coverage{attempted, passed, failed, blocked, skipped}` per workflow run. Findings derived from `steps[].status==fail`. Verdict gate distinguishes "ran clean" from "didn't run".

After Codex GPT-5 cross-AI review, the abstraction was widened from "5 CRUD lenses" to "state transition with invariants" — `(role, resource, precondition, action, expected_state_delta, forbidden_side_effects)`. CRUD round-trip is the first kit; v2.36+ will add approval-flow, bulk-action, settings-toggle.

### Architecture

```
Manager (Claude Sonnet via Task)              ← reads CRUD-SURFACES, dispatches
  ├─ scripts/review-fixture-bootstrap.py       ← issues ephemeral tokens per role
  ├─ scripts/extract-routes-static.py          ← graphify-less route extractor
  ├─ scripts/verify-routes-live.py             ← URL drift gate (closes #50)
  ├─ scripts/merge-nav-by-role.py              ← 3-role navigator merger
  ├─ scripts/discover-iteration.py             ← iterative re-discovery (max 2 iter)
  ├─ scripts/spawn-crud-roundtrip.py           ← worker dispatcher (Gemini Flash)
  └─ scripts/derive-findings.py                ← Strix-style findings + REVIEW-BUGS.md
       │
       └─ Workers (Gemini Flash via gemini CLI)
              ├─ -p "@crud-roundtrip.md + context"
              ├─ -m gemini-2.5-flash             ← $0.075/M = 13× cheaper than Haiku
              ├─ --approval-mode yolo
              ├─ --allowed-mcp-server-names playwright1
              └─ writes runs/{resource}-{role}.json (run artifact)
```

### Worker tier — Gemini Flash via gemini CLI

Cost per phase (30 round-trip workflows × ~20k tokens):
- Haiku 4.5: ~$0.60
- DeepSeek V3 (via opencode): ~$0.16
- **Gemini-2.5-flash: ~$0.045** (13× cheaper than Haiku, 3.7× cheaper than DeepSeek)

Gemini CLI already MCP-configured by `install.sh` (5 Playwright servers in `~/.gemini/settings.json`). Already in cross-CLI plumbing. Zero new dependency.

### Closes #50 — Build URL drift gate

`scripts/verify-routes-live.py` probes every registered route against the running app via `curl --head`. Classifies live/drift/error/auth_only. With `--gate` flag, exits 1 on drift detected. Routes loaded from either `routes-static.json` (extract-routes-static.py output), `CRUD-SURFACES.md`, or both.

### Closes #51 — Verdict gate hardening (3 invariants)

Replaces path-existence checks with content invariants. AI cannot write empty artifacts to bypass review verdict.

1. **`verify-haiku-scan-completeness.py`** — every non-UNREACHABLE view in nav-discovery.json must have `scan-{slug}.json` with `elements_total >= 1`
2. **`verify-runtime-map-coverage.py`** — every UI-surface goal in TEST-GOALS.md must have `views[X].elements > 0` AND `goal_sequences[id].steps > 0` in RUNTIME-MAP.json
3. **`verify-crud-runs-coverage.py`** — every `(resource × role)` declared with `kit: crud-roundtrip` must have `runs/{resource}-{role}.json` with `coverage.attempted >= 1` and `evidence_ref` populated per non-skipped step

Override per-phase via `--skip-content-invariants=<reason>` (logs OVERRIDE-DEBT for post-merge triage).

### New transition kit format

`commands/vg/_shared/transition-kits/crud-roundtrip.md` — first kit. Format mirrors Strix's vulnerability skills (~150 lines markdown teaching LLM how to test, not runnable code). 8-step round-trip per (resource × role):

1. Read list (baseline) — capture row count, columns, sample rows
2. Create — submit valid payload OR verify role denied (matrix-driven)
3. Read list (persistence) — verify row count incremented + new row visible
4. Read detail — verify all fields persisted
5. Update — modify field OR verify role denied
6. Read detail (apply) — verify field changed (compare actual values, not `updated_at` to avoid clock-skew)
7. Delete — confirm dialog handling + DELETE OR verify role denied
8. Read list (deletion) — entity gone (hard) OR archived (soft per `delete_policy`)

Per-step expected behavior matrix from `CRUD-SURFACES.expected_behavior[role]` block. Per-run unique payload values (`name: "vg-review-{run_id}-create"`) avoid collisions across parallel workers.

### Findings schema — Strix-influenced

Enriched per Codex review feedback. Severity separated from security_impact:

```json
{
  "id": "F-001",
  "title": "...",
  "severity": "critical|high|medium|low|info",
  "security_impact": "auth_bypass|scope_violation|data_integrity|tenant_leakage|info_disclosure|none",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "dedupe_key": "<resource>-<role>-<step>-<normalized_title>",
  "actor": {"role": "...", "user_id": "...", "tenant": "..."},
  "environment": "...",
  "step_ref": "step-2",
  "request": {...},
  "response": {...},
  "trace_id": "...",
  "data_created": [{"resource": "topup_requests", "id": "tr-x"}],
  "cleanup_status": "completed|partial|skipped",
  "remediation_steps": [...],
  "cwe": "CWE-862"
}
```

`REVIEW-BUGS.md` is the human-readable triage doc, sorted by severity. Findings NOT auto-routed to `/vg:build` in v2.35.0 (deferred to v2.37 after schema dogfood validates dedupe + confidence quality).

### Auth fixture — credentials never committed

Codex review flagged credentials-in-config as bad. Fixed:

- `vg.config.md` declares `review.roles: [...]` and `review.auth.base_url`
- `.review-fixtures/seed-users.local.yaml` — gitignored, user-managed credentials
- `.review-fixtures/tokens.local.yaml` — gitignored, ephemeral tokens issued by `review-fixture-bootstrap.py` against the app's login API
- `.gitignore` updated automatically by bootstrap script

### Auth-aware navigator (3-role discovery)

Navigator runs 3× (admin/user/anon), captures union of visible routes per role into a role-visibility matrix:

```json
{
  "views": {
    "/admin/users": {
      "visible_to": ["admin"],
      "denied_for": ["user", "anon"],
      "discovery_role_evidence": {
        "admin": {"http_status": 200, "in_sidebar": true},
        "user": {"http_status": 403, "in_sidebar": false},
        "anon": {"http_status": 401, "in_sidebar": false}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Workers spawned by `spawn-crud-roundtrip.py` read this matrix to know expected behavior per role per view.

### Iterative re-discovery (max 2 iter, +5 views/iter)

`discover-iteration.py` reads `scan-*.json sub_views_discovered[]` after Phase 2b-3 collect+merge. New views not in initial nav-discovery get queued for additional Haiku scans. Caps prevent runaway discovery.

### Static route extractor (graphify-less fallback)

`extract-routes-static.py` provides regex-based route discovery for projects without graphify configured. Patterns cover Express/Fastify/Hono, FastAPI/Flask/Django, React Router/Vue Router, Next.js Pages+App Router, Go (Echo/Gin/chi). Smoke-tested on multi-framework fixture: 7 routes detected across 4 frameworks with no false positives.

### Sequence note

Per discussion 2026-04-30, this is fix 2 of 4 for the systemic *"review hời hợt"* pattern:

- v2.34.0 (shipped) — closes #52 (review→test back-flow)
- **v2.35.0 (this)** — closes #50 + #51 (URL drift + scanner content invariants + CRUD round-trip)
- v2.36.0 — closes #49 (blueprint expand TEST-GOALS from CRUD-SURFACES) + 2 more transition kits
- v2.37.0 — auto-route findings to /vg:build (after schema dogfood)

---

## v2.34.0 (2026-04-30) — review→test goal-enrichment back-flow (closes #52)

User feedback: *"chúng ta đã build từ ban đầu là review sẽ spawn haiku, với codex thì sẽ chạy trong session để dò và vẽ ra bản đồ UI, từ đó bấm rất nhiều component và rich thêm goals tổng hợp cho đoạn test sau đó, nhưng có vẻ nó đang bị bỏ quên."*

The original 4-step `/vg:review` design:
1. Spawn Haiku/in-session Codex
2. Discover UI + draw map → `views[X].elements[]`
3. Click many components → `scan-{view}.json`
4. **Enrich TEST-GOALS for test layer** ← MISSING

Steps 1–3 were implemented; step 4 never wired. Result: `views[X].elements[]` accumulated 200+ runtime-discovered components (buttons, mutations, forms, tables, tabs), but no code consumed them. `/vg:test` codegen used only the 67 high-level goals from blueprint. ~70%+ of runtime-observed surface left untested.

Cross-grep confirmed before this release:
```
"enrich", "discovered_goals", "G-AUTO", "G-DISCOVER",
"TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED" → 0 matches in commands/ or scripts/
```

### What this release adds

- **NEW** `scripts/enrich-test-goals.py` — parses every `scan-*.json` under `${PHASE_DIR}`, classifies elements (modal triggers, mutation buttons, forms, table row actions, paging, tabs), dedupes against existing `TEST-GOALS.md` `interactive_controls`, and emits `${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md` with `G-AUTO-*` goal stubs in YAML frontmatter format (mirrors `TEST-GOAL-enriched-template.md` schema). Has a `--validate-only` mode that exits 1 when any view has elements scanned but zero auto-goals derived (catches scanner output drift).

- **NEW** `scripts/codegen-auto-goals.py` — sister script that reads `TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md` and emits skeleton Playwright specs `auto-{goal-id-slug}.spec.ts` to `GENERATED_TESTS_DIR`. No LLM call (auto-goals are review-grade stubs documenting what scanner observed; reviewer iterates on next blueprint pass). Each spec is `test.fail()` until reviewer fleshes out selectors, with comment block listing trigger/main_steps/alternate_flows/postconditions/observed-endpoint from runtime evidence.

- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/review.md` — new step `phase2c_enrich_test_goals` after `2b-3 collect+merge`. Invokes enrich script + validator. BLOCKS review if enrichment coverage gap detected (override via `--skip-enrich-validate=<reason>` logs OVERRIDE-DEBT).

- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/test.md` — new substep `5d-auto` after main `5d_codegen`. Invokes codegen-auto-goals script. Skeleton specs land in same dir as main codegen output, prefixed `auto-` for visual distinction.

### Goal stub categories emitted

| Element source | Goal stub | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `results[].outcome == "modal_opened"` | `G-AUTO-{view}-modal-{name}` | important |
| `results[].network[].method ∈ {POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE}` | `G-AUTO-{view}-mutation-{name}-{method}` | critical |
| `forms[]` | `G-AUTO-{view}-form-{trigger}` | critical |
| `tables[].actions_per_row[]` | `G-AUTO-{view}-row-{action}` | important |
| `tables[].row_count > 0` (no declared pagination) | `G-AUTO-{view}-table-paging` | important |
| `tabs[]` | `G-AUTO-{view}-tab-{name}` | nice-to-have |

Each stub includes `evidence{}` block with scan_ref + observed endpoint/status for traceability. `interactive_controls` declared in source TEST-GOALS.md (`filters`, `pagination`, `sort`) cause matching auto-goals to be skipped (avoid duplicates).

### Smoke-tested

- Fixture phase with 1 existing goal + 1 view scan (12 elements) → 8 auto-goals emitted (1 modal + 1 mutation + 1 form + 3 row-actions + 2 tabs). Pagination correctly skipped because declared in source. 8 skeleton specs written.
- `--validate-only` mode: passes when all views have ≥1 auto-goal; fails with concrete view-level gap message when scanner output drifted.
- Spec output validates: `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'` syntax, `test.describe` block, single-quote escaping in titles + main_steps comments.

### Sequence note

This is the FIRST of 4 fixes for the systemic *"review hời hợt"* pattern. Per discussion 2026-04-30:

- v2.34.0 (this release) — closes #52 (back-flow gap)
- v2.35.0 — closes #51 (Haiku scanner content invariants)
- v2.36.0 — closes #49 (blueprint expand goals from CRUD-SURFACES)
- v2.37.0 — closes #50 (build URL-drift gate)

Reasoning for upstream-first: a hardened scanner output without a consumer is wasted; goal expansion at planner-time is wasted if test layer can't pull from runtime discoveries. Wire the back-flow first, then harden the producers.

## v2.33.0 (2026-04-30) — milestone pipeline (full GSD parity)

User feedback: "VG có tính năng milestone như GSD chưa?" Audit found VG had milestone *concept* (STATE.md `current_milestone`, `## Milestone N` headings in PROJECT.md, `.vg/milestones/{M}/` archive dir, `/vg:security-audit-milestone`, `/vg:project --milestone`) but **no closeout pipeline**. `security-audit-milestone.md:205` referenced `/vg:complete-milestone` as if it existed; it didn't. Dead code path waiting for an orchestrator.

v2.33.0 builds the full pipeline.

### New commands

- **`/vg:milestone-summary {M}`** — aggregate report across all phases in milestone M. Phase pipeline status (specs/plan/build/review/test/UAT) per phase, goal coverage rolled up by priority (critical/important/nice-to-have), decisions inventory (D-XX namespace count), security register snapshot (open threats by severity), override-debt entries carried forward, companion artifact links (security-audit-*.md, SECURITY-PENTEST-CHECKLIST.md, STRIX-ADVISORY.md from v2.32.0), timeline (first commit → last commit). Re-runnable — non-mutating view.
- **`/vg:complete-milestone {M}`** — atomic milestone closeout orchestrator. Six-step flow: (1) gate check via `complete-milestone.py --check` (all phases UAT-accepted, no critical OPEN threats, no critical OVERRIDE-DEBT unresolved); (2) security audit hand-off to `/vg:security-audit-milestone --milestone-gate`; (3) regenerate `MILESTONE-SUMMARY.md`; (4) `git mv .vg/phases/{N}/` → `.vg/milestones/{M}/phases/{N}/` (history preserved); (5) advance STATE.md (`current_milestone` → next, append `milestones_completed[]` entry); (6) atomic commit with `milestone(close):` subject prefix. Override flags `--allow-open-critical=<reason>` + `--allow-open-override-debt=<reason>` log to OVERRIDE-DEBT for next-milestone triage.

### Phase membership resolution

Both commands resolve "which phases belong to milestone M" via three patterns against ROADMAP.md:

```
## M1 …
## Milestone M1 …
## Milestone 1 …
```

Falls back to all phases if no milestone section found (single-milestone projects). Override with `--phases <range>` (e.g. `--phases 3-7`).

### State schema additions

`STATE.md` (still pure markdown, parsed via regex):

```yaml
current_milestone: M2          # was M1, advanced by complete-milestone
milestones_completed:
  - id: M1
    completed_at: 2026-04-30T12:34:56Z
    phases: [2, 5, 7]
```

`.vg/milestones/{M}/.completed` JSON marker also written:

```json
{
  "milestone": "M1",
  "completed_at": "2026-04-30T12:34:56Z",
  "phase_count": 3,
  "vgflow_version": "2.33.0"
}
```

### Wired references

- `commands/vg/next.md:279` — Route 9 (all phases done) now points to `/vg:complete-milestone {M}` first, then `/vg:project --milestone` for next-milestone scoping.
- `commands/vg/progress.md:295` — same redirect.
- `README.md` command reference — new "Milestone (v2.33.0+)" section.

### Closes the v2.32.0 dead path

`security-audit-milestone.md:205` `--milestone-gate` flag has been waiting for an orchestrator since the file was written. v2.33.0's `/vg:complete-milestone` is that orchestrator. The flag now fires.

### Smoke-tested

- Fixture milestone with 2 phases (1 accepted, 1 missing UAT) → `--check` exits 1, blocker message lists missing phase. After UAT.md added → `--check` passes.
- `--finalize` writes STATE.md atomically (current_milestone advances, milestones_completed[] appended), writes `.completed` marker JSON.
- Re-run `--finalize` is idempotent (doesn't duplicate `milestones_completed[]` entry for same id).
- `--allow-open-critical="reason"` waives security gate, logs to OVERRIDE-DEBT carry-forward.

## v2.32.1 (2026-04-30) — CRUD-depth review/test hardening (#47, #48)

Patch release for the review/test false-pass class where a CRUD-heavy phase
could define many goals but downstream evidence only showed a list page or
group-level static scan.

### Fix

- **Review matrix merger** now downgrades mutation goals from READY to BLOCKED
  when `RUNTIME-MAP.goal_sequences[G-XX]` lacks a successful
  POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE observation or lacks persistence proof.
- **New validator** `verify-runtime-map-crud-depth.py` is wired into
  `/vg:review` and `/vg:test`, registered as unquarantinable, and catches:
  list-only mutation evidence, mutation without persistence probe, and
  CRUD UI goals backed by `CRUD-SURFACES.md` that only have group-level
  `goal_sequences` instead of per-goal `G-XX` entries.
- **/vg:test structural fallback** now handles legacy READY artifacts that
  lack a per-goal sequence: non-mutation CRUD goals must generate a
  non-skipped `STRUCTURAL_FROM_CRUD_SURFACES` Playwright spec from
  `CRUD-SURFACES.md`; mutation goals still hard-block until review records
  real runtime mutation + persistence evidence.
- **Mutation codegen contract** is tightened from 3 layers to 4 layers:
  toast, API 2xx, persistence after refresh/re-read, and no console errors.
- **Codex + Claude mirrors** regenerated/synced so both runtimes enforce the
  same review/test rules.

### Verification

- `python -m pytest scripts/tests/test_runtime_map_crud_depth.py scripts/tests/test_crud_surface_workflow_wiring.py scripts/tests/test_mutation_layers.py`
  → 20 passed.
- `python scripts/ci/validator_smoke.py` → all validators compile and emit
  schema-compatible JSON for smokeable validators.
- `python scripts/verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py` → 64 mirror pairs OK.

## v2.32.0 (2026-04-29) — Strix scan advisory plugin (end-of-milestone)

User asked: học được gì từ usestrix/strix về autopentest? Decision: Strix's domain (Docker sandbox + LLM-powered ReAct loop + actual exploit execution) is intentionally **outside** VG's dependency surface. VG aggregates threat-model declarations and curates an advisory recommending the user run Strix — same pattern as Step 5 (`SECURITY-PENTEST-CHECKLIST.md` for human pentesters).

### What this is NOT

- VG does not bundle Strix.
- VG does not run Strix.
- VG does not parse Strix output (yet).
- No new gate, no new BLOCK condition, no new dependency.

### What this is

End-of-milestone Step 6 inside `/vg:security-audit-milestone`. Aggregates the milestone's adversarial surface (declarative `adversarial_scope.threats` from each phase's TEST-GOALS.md + HTTP endpoints from API-CONTRACTS.md grouped by auth model) and emits two artifacts:

- `.vg/milestones/{M}/STRIX-ADVISORY.md` — markdown advisory with: why-this-matters summary, ready-to-copy `docker run ghcr.io/usestrix/strix:latest …` invocation tailored to declared threats, threat → goal traceability table, endpoint surface per phase, post-scan triage guidance, resource expectations.
- `.vg/milestones/{M}/strix-scope.json` — machine-readable scope payload for Strix's `--scope-file` flag (schema_version, target_url, threats, threat_goals, endpoints_by_phase).

### Files

- **NEW** `scripts/generate-strix-advisory.py` — phase walker + advisor renderer. Stdlib-only with optional PyYAML; falls back to regex when PyYAML missing. Resolves milestone scope via STATE.md / ROADMAP.md or explicit `--phases <range>`.
- **MODIFY** `commands/vg/security-audit-milestone.md` — Step 6 added. Reads `security.strix_advisor.enabled` (default true). Skips with explicit log line when disabled.
- **MODIFY** `vg.config.template.md` — `security.strix_advisor.{enabled, target_url}` config block under existing `security:` namespace.

### Why plugin, not core integration

Strix needs Docker + a separate LLM API key + a reachable target URL. Forcing those into VG's install path would break library / CLI / mobile-only project profiles. Step 6 generates an actionable recommendation; the user decides whether to spend the Docker setup + LLM tokens. After Strix runs, the user triages findings into `.vg/SECURITY-REGISTER.md` manually — auto-import is intentionally not provided so findings land with proper phase scope, owner, and severity in the project context.

### Smoke verified

- Fixture milestone with 2 phases, 4 distinct threats, 3 endpoints with mixed auth model (public/authenticated/admin) → advisory groups correctly per auth bucket.
- Empty milestone (no `adversarial_scope` declarations, no API-CONTRACTS) → "Nothing to advise" stanza, no spurious docker invocation.
- Disabled via `security.strix_advisor.enabled: false` → Step 6 logs "(strix_advisor disabled in vg.config.md — skipping Step 6)" and exits cleanly.

## v2.31.1 (2026-04-29) - no-session active-run fallback fix

v2.31.0 published successfully, but the `main` test workflow exposed an older
v2.28 active-run regression: when `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` was absent, `run-start`
wrote `.vg/active-runs/unknown.json` while `run-complete` only looked for an
explicit session id. CLI/CI runs without Claude session env therefore reported
`No active run to complete`.

### Fix

- `scripts/vg-orchestrator/state.py` now consistently defaults
  read/write/clear operations to the `unknown` active-run slot when no session
  id is available.
- Restores no-session CLI behavior while keeping v2.28 multi-session isolation
  for real Claude sessions.
- `scripts/tests/test_bypass_negative.py` now passes locally (`10 passed`),
  restoring the CI negative-bypass suite.

---

## v2.31.0 (2026-04-29) - design-grounded blueprint/build hard gate (#45)

User reported a serious design/build pipeline bug: UI phases could reach build
without blueprint first ensuring that real mockups existed, were copied into the
phase design directory, and were normalized into design-ref slugs. Build also
had multiple design lookup paths, so a task could reference a design that one
stage accepted but another stage could not resolve.

### Closes #45

- `/vg:blueprint` now owns UI design setup end-to-end. Before planning, it
  detects UI phases from phase artifacts, imports existing mockups from
  `design_assets.paths` and common mockup directories into phase-local
  `design/`, auto-runs `/vg:design-scaffold --tool=pencil-mcp` when no mockups
  exist, then auto-runs `/vg:design-extract --auto` so PLAN generation can use
  real `<design-ref>` slugs.
- `/vg:build` now blocks before executor spawn when any `<design-ref>` slug is
  missing. The gate uses the same resolver as pre-executor checks and visual
  validators, covering phase `design/`, transitional `designs/`, shared design
  system assets, and legacy fallback roots consistently.
- Added `scripts/blueprint-design-preflight.py`, `scripts/design-ref-check.py`,
  and `scripts/lib/design_ref_resolver.py` as the shared Python design
  resolution layer.
- `/vg:review`, `pre-executor-check.py`, and design/vision validators now share
  that resolver instead of duplicating path assumptions.
- `/vg:design-scaffold` writes to phase-local `design/`; `/vg:design-extract`
  and shared shell helpers retain `designs/` as a transitional read fallback.
- Codex skill mirrors regenerated for blueprint/build/review/design scaffold and
  extract so release tarballs do not ship stale command mirrors.

## v2.30.0 (2026-04-29) — design path 2-tier layout + migration script

User reported design assets landing in project-level `.vg/design-normalized/` regardless of which phase generated them. Root cause: `design-extract.md` had a single hardcoded output dir from `vg.config.md:design_assets.output_dir`; no per-phase scoping.

### 2-tier design path layout

v2.30.0 introduces a 2-tier structure:

- **Tier 1 — phase-scoped** `.vg/phases/{N}/design/`: assets that belong to exactly one phase. `/vg:design-extract` writes here by default for all per-phase design work.
- **Tier 2 — project-shared** `.vg/design-system/`: cross-phase brand assets, design tokens, shared component screenshots. `/vg:design-extract --shared` writes here.
- **Tier 3 — legacy** `.vg/design-normalized/` (soft-deprecated): read-fallback for 2 releases; WARN on first use.

### New files

- **`commands/vg/_shared/lib/design-path-resolver.sh`** — resolver helper. Functions: `vg_design_phase_dir`, `vg_design_shared_dir`, `vg_design_legacy_dir`, `vg_resolve_design_ref` (3-tier read with fallback), `vg_resolve_design_dir` (write target with scope). All consumers source this instead of hardcoding paths.
- **`scripts/migrate-design-paths.py`** — one-shot migration script. Walks legacy `.vg/design-normalized/`, scans `PLAN.md <design-ref slug="...">` citations to classify each slug: single-phase cite → `phases/{N}/design/`; multi-phase cite → `.vg/design-system/`; no cite → `.vg/design-system/orphans/`. Pre-migration backup to `.vg/.design-migration-backup/{ts}/`. Dry-run by default; pass `--apply` to move.

### Files modified

- `commands/vg/design-extract.md` — `WRITE_SCOPE` dispatch: `--shared` → Tier 2, default → Tier 1 via `vg_resolve_design_dir`. Step 2 uses resolver.
- `commands/vg/blueprint.md` — design section sources resolver; detects which tier has manifest.json; WARN on legacy path use.
- `commands/vg/accept.md` — design baseline `BASELINE_PNG` resolved via `vg_resolve_design_ref` (3-tier fallback); legacy absolute path kept as human-readable error fallback.
- `install.sh` — new `--migrate-design` flag: runs `migrate-design-paths.py --apply` on target project after all files are installed.

### Migration for existing projects

```bash
# Dry-run first (default):
python3 .claude/scripts/migrate-design-paths.py --repo . --verbose

# Apply when ready:
python3 .claude/scripts/migrate-design-paths.py --repo . --apply --verbose

# Or during fresh install on a project that has legacy design dir:
bash /path/to/vgflow/install.sh --migrate-design /path/to/project
```

## v2.29.0 (2026-04-29) — utcnow() deprecation cleanup + #41/#42 update self-deploy fix

User reported v2.28.0 install on PrintwayV3 still emitting `DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated` from `vg-verify-claim.py:74` + `:96`. Triage found two layers:

1. **PrintwayV3 install was actually pre-v2.22** — DeprecationWarning fix landed v2.22.0, but `/vg:update` silent-merge bug (#30) parked the fixed `vg-verify-claim.py` as `.conflict` and never wrote the upstream copy. v2.24.0 fixed `three_way_merge()`, but the fix lives IN `scripts/vg_update.py` itself — chicken-and-egg #42.
2. **18 other call-sites in canonical still used `utcnow()`** in command markdown + shared libs. Even after fixing the install-update path, those sites would emit warnings at every `/vg:scope`, `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:accept` run on Python 3.12+.

### Closes #41, #42

- **#42** `commands/vg/update.md`: self-bootstrap the merge helper. `vg_update.py` is loaded from the **freshly downloaded tarball**, not from `.claude/scripts/vg_update.py`. A stale/broken installed helper can no longer prevent its own replacement from landing. Refuses to bump `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION` if core update files (`scripts/vg_update.py`, `commands/vg/update.md`, `commands/vg/reapply-patches.md`) did not land — surfaces silent partial upgrades.
- **#42** `install.sh --refresh`: new flag that backs up VG-managed files in target install before refreshing, so users stuck on stale helper can `bash install.sh --refresh /path/to/project` to force-overwrite. Fresh installs now seed `.claude/vgflow-ancestor/v{version}/` so future 3-way updates have a real baseline (eliminates the "ancestor missing → force-upstream → silent overwrite" cliff).
- **#42** `commands/vg/update.md`: pre-flight integrity scan before merge loop. Walks tarball + install + ancestor, classifies each file (`clean` / `new` / `force_upstream_at_risk` / `skipped`), prints count + first 10 at-risk filenames BEFORE files are overwritten. Audit window for users with missing ancestor stash.
- **#41** `commands/vg/_shared/lib/bug-reporter.sh:bug_reporter_github_submit_from_event()`: GitHub issue body construction no longer embeds `$event` JSON directly into a Python triple-quoted heredoc. Switched to env var (`BR_EVENT="$event" python3 -c '...'`) with single-quoted Python source so backslash/quote/triple-quote/`$`/backtick chars in event payload no longer cause SyntaxError → empty issue body. v2.28.0 fixed the `report_event()` upstream pipeline; this fix completes the chain by also escaping the downstream submit path.

### utcnow() cleanup

Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (or `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)` for module-style imports) in 11 canonical files. Imports updated to include `timezone` where needed. Output identical (`%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`).

Files touched:
- `commands/vg/accept.md`, `project.md`, `scope.md`, `scope-review.md`, `review.md` (×6 sites), `test.md` (×3 sites)
- `commands/vg/_shared/artifact-manifest.md`
- `commands/vg/_shared/lib/artifact-manifest.sh`, `bootstrap-inject.sh`, `matrix-merger.sh`, `scaffold-stitch.sh`

Codex skill mirrors regenerated.

### Recovery for users stuck on pre-v2.22

Two paths:

1. **Clean refresh (recommended)**: `bash install.sh --refresh /path/to/project` from this updated vgflow-repo. Backs up VG-managed files, force-overwrites with v2.29.0 baseline.
2. **Manual hook scripts only**: copy `scripts/vg-verify-claim.py`, `scripts/vg-orchestrator/state.py`, `scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__.py`, `scripts/vg-build-crossai-loop.py` into `<project>/.claude/scripts/` directly.

After v2.29.0, `/vg:update` self-bootstrap closes the trap — future updates use the upstream helper, not the installed one.

## v2.28.0 (2026-04-29) — multi-tenant active-run + #37/38/39 + bug-reporter context

User pushback: "tôi bật 2 cửa sổ, 2 session khác phase, cái nào làm sau bị lock". Plus 6 open GitHub issues (#34–39). Triage found two truly independent failure modes the user perceived as a single "lock" symptom, and three low-context auto-reported bugs traced to one root cause.

### Root causes addressed

1. **`current-run.json` was single-tenant.** A second `/vg:*` invocation on the same project blocked at `cmd_run_start` with `⛔ Active run exists` — even when started from a different Claude Code session. v2.24.0 cross-session detection patched the Stop hook side, never the run-start side.
2. **`commit-attribution.py` greps the commit body** (issue #37). On phase 2, `git log --grep="\(2[-.0-9]*-[0-9]+\):"` matched a pre-existing commit whose body contained `(2026-04-22):` (year `2026` parsed as `2`+`-`+`22`). Pre-existing commit hard-flagged as `subject_format_violation`, blocking `/vg:build run-complete` deterministically. THIS was the actual cause of the user's screenshot — not the multi-session race.
3. **`emit_event` raised EmitError when `current-run.json` had empty `run_id`** (issue #39). Mid-CrossAI-loop run-abort or run-repair cleared state; the loop's expensive Codex+Gemini work succeeded but post-completion event emit fell through and the build BLOCKed. Chicken-and-egg.
4. **Parallel executor agents staged files BEFORE acquiring the commit-queue mutex** (issue #38). The mutex only protected `commit`, not the index. First agent to acquire absorbed the second agent's pre-staged files → cross-attribution corruption.
5. **`bug-reporter.sh` substituted `${context}` into a Python triple-quoted string literal** (issues #34/35/36). Any context with a quote, triple-quote, or newline produced a SyntaxError; `2>/dev/null` swallowed the error → empty data → GitHub issues with empty `Context: \`\`\`json\n\n\`\`\`` blocks.
6. **`__main__.py` referenced `timezone.utc` without importing `timezone`** (pre-existing, latent). `_is_run_stale()` always took the exception path → returned True for every run. v2.24.0 fixed the same pattern in `vg-verify-claim.py` but missed `__main__.py`. Cross-session WARN never fired and same-session block path was unreachable in production.

### Multi-tenant active-run state

- **NEW** `.vg/active-runs/{session_id}.json` — per-session state, authoritative for that session.
- `.vg/current-run.json` — kept as latest-write snapshot for `run-status` aggregate view + pre-v2.28.0 install fallback.
- `state.py` rewritten with `read_active_run` / `write_active_run` / `clear_active_run` / `list_active_runs` keyed by session_id. Legacy `read_current_run` / `write_current_run` / `clear_current_run` shims route through the new API via env `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`.
- `cmd_run_start`: same-session active → existing block-or-stale-clear logic. Other-session active → WARN nhẹ (not blocking) noting shared git index + commit-queue mutex. Two windows on different phases can now coexist.
- `cmd_run_status`: shows current session run + `other_sessions_active` array of sibling sessions for awareness.
- `vg-verify-claim.py`: Stop hook reads per-session file via `hook_input.session_id`; cross-session detection retained as defense-in-depth.
- `vg-entry-hook.py`, `vg-agent-spawn-guard.py`: per-session reads + propagate `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env to subprocess invocations of orchestrator (Claude Code provides session_id via stdin only, not env — manual propagation required).

### Issue fixes (closes #37, #38, #39, #34, #35, #36)

- **#37** `commit-attribution.py:git_log_subjects()`: replaced `git log --grep=PATTERN` (which scans body) with raw `git log --pretty=format:%H%x00%s%x00%b%x01 -2000` then Python-side `re.match` against subject only. Body is no longer scanned for phase regex; date strings in commit bodies can no longer trigger phantom violations.
- **#38** `build-commit-queue.sh`: new `vg_commit_with_files <task_id> <max_wait> <msg_file> <file>...` primitive. Atomic stage+commit inside the mutex with explicit file list — impossible to stage before acquire by construction. Plus diagnostic warning when index has pre-staged files at acquire time. `vg-executor-rules.md` § Parallel-wave commit safety: added explicit "⛔ DO NOT run `git add` BEFORE acquire" rule + showcased the new helper as preferred primitive.
- **#39** `vg-build-crossai-loop.py:emit_event()`: added `_resolve_active_run(phase)` with 3-tier fallback — (1) `.vg/active-runs/{session_id}.json`, (2) legacy `.vg/current-run.json`, (3) SQLite `runs` table for the most recent open `vg:build` row at this phase. Recovers the chicken-and-egg trap; only raises EmitError if all three sources fail.
- **#34/35/36** `bug-reporter.sh:report_bug()` + `report_event()`: pass `sig`, `context`, `redacted` data via env vars (`BR_SIG`, `BR_CTX`, `BR_DATA`) instead of substituting into Python source. Python reads from `os.environ` — fully byte-safe regardless of quotes, triple-quotes, newlines, `$`, backticks. Plus sentinel fallback if encode still fails so issue body never goes empty.

### Smoke matrix verified

- 2 sessions, same project, different phases (`/vg:scope 1` + `/vg:build 2`) → both start, WARN visible to second session.
- `run-status` from session A shows `this_session=A` + `other_sessions_active=[B]`.
- `run-abort` from session A clears only sessionA.json; sessionB.json untouched.
- commit-attribution: fixture repo with body containing `(2026-04-22):` + a real `feat(2-01):` commit → PASS (date string no longer flagged).
- emit_event: simulated empty current-run.json + open vg:build row in events.db → resolves run_id from DB, no EmitError.
- vg_commit_with_files: pre-staged file from prior crashed task → diagnostic WARN + acquire's orphan-clean unstages → final commit contains only the requested files.
- bug-reporter: adversarial context (newline + triple-quote + single-quote + `$dollar`) → event JSON properly nests data with chars preserved.

### Compatibility

- Pre-v2.28.0 installs missing `.vg/active-runs/` directory → `read_active_run()` falls back to legacy `current-run.json`. No state migration required.
- Subprocess CLAUDE_SESSION_ID propagation is opt-in (passes if env present); no env present → falls back to legacy single-tenant behavior. Old hooks keep working.

### User action

After `/vg:update` lands v2.28.0:
- 2 windows on same project: just open both — the second `/vg:build` no longer blocks. WARN about shared git index appears once per run-start.
- Old `current-run.json` snapshot preserved as latest-write mirror; can be safely deleted if state seems wedged.

## v2.27.0 (2026-04-28) — programmatic gsd-* spawn guard (PreToolUse hook)

User pushback on v2.26.0: "rule chỉ là text, có chắc AI sẽ không gọi GSD nữa không?". Right — informational reinforcement is a soft enforce. Investigation found a real programmatic mechanism + shipped it.

### Investigation

GSD's own `execute-phase.md` workflow uses identical text-only enforcement:

```
<available_agent_types>
- gsd-executor — Executes plan tasks, commits, creates SUMMARY.md
- gsd-verifier — ...
Always use the exact name from this list — do not fall back to
'general-purpose' or other built-in types
</available_agent_types>
```

GSD has no programmatic guard either. Both VG (now) and GSD relied on the AI reading prose. Both had drift exactly because Claude Code's agent picker scores subagent descriptions and can override "soft should-not" rules from the calling skill.

**Real enforcement vector found:** Claude Code's PreToolUse hook with `matcher: "Agent"` receives the full `tool_input` (including `subagent_type`) BEFORE the spawn fires. Returning `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}` blocks the spawn AND delivers the reason to Claude for the next turn so it re-spawns correctly.

This is a hard enforce — not a rule the AI can rationalize past, an OS-level interception of the tool call.

### Fix

- **NEW** `scripts/vg-agent-spawn-guard.py`: PreToolUse hook script. Logic:
  1. Reads stdin JSON for `tool_name` + `tool_input.subagent_type`
  2. If tool isn't `Agent` → allow (no-op for Bash/Read/Edit/etc.)
  3. If subagent_type doesn't start with `gsd-` → allow (general-purpose, Explore, custom agents pass)
  4. If subagent_type is in allow-list (`gsd-debugger` only — VG legitimately uses it in build.md step 12) → allow
  5. If `.vg/current-run.json` doesn't exist OR active run command doesn't start with `vg:` → allow (don't break GSD users running `/gsd-execute-phase` directly)
  6. Otherwise → DENY with detailed reason listing VG vs GSD rule-set differences and instructing re-spawn with `general-purpose`
- `scripts/vg-hooks-install.py`: new `PreToolUse` matcher entry for `Agent`. Wires the guard into `.claude/settings.local.json` on next install/repair pass. Allow-list extended for the new script.
- `commands/vg/build.md` step 7: appends "Programmatic enforcement (v2.27.0+)" block telling AI the hook exists and what its deny message looks like — so when the AI sees the reason, it knows the hook fired correctly and re-spawns instead of treating the deny as a transient error.

### Smoke-tested 6 scenarios

- gsd-executor in active VG run → DENY with reason ✓
- general-purpose in active VG run → ALLOW (empty stdout) ✓
- gsd-debugger in active VG run → ALLOW (allow-listed) ✓
- gsd-executor outside any VG run (no current-run.json) → ALLOW ✓
- gsd-executor with stale non-VG run (e.g., gsd:execute-phase active) → ALLOW ✓
- Non-Agent tool (Bash) during VG run → ALLOW ✓

### User action

Re-run hooks installer to land the new guard:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
python3 .claude/scripts/vg-hooks-install.py
```

Or the full sync:

```bash
bash sync.sh /path/to/your/project
```

After install, hooks active on next Claude Code session start. Test by running `/vg:build <phase>` and observe wave dispatch — should consistently show `general-purpose(Wave N Task M)`. If you intentionally try to spawn `gsd-executor` (e.g., for debugging), the hook will deny with a clear message; you'll see it in next turn.

**Note on GSD compatibility:** Hook is no-op outside VG context. `/gsd-execute-phase`, `/gsd-autonomous`, etc. continue to spawn `gsd-executor` normally because their `current-run.json` either doesn't exist (not VG-managed) or has a non-`vg:` command prefix. No interference with users who use both VG + GSD on different projects.

### Closed
N/A — pushback follow-up to v2.26.0; no separate issue. Reinforces the v2.20-v2.26 chain.

## v2.26.0 (2026-04-28) — hardened gsd-executor rejection in build.md (root cause traced)

User reported `gsd-executor(Wave 6 Task 16 — Replica set verify)` STILL appearing in wave dispatch despite v2.25.0's text-only fix. Investigation traced the actual root cause this time.

### Root cause

`gsd-executor` is a real agent registered globally at `~/.claude/agents/gsd-executor.md`. It ships with the GSD workflow, has `name: gsd-executor` and description "Executes GSD plans with atomic commits, deviation handling, checkpoint protocols, and state management. Spawned by execute-phase orchestrator or execute-plan command."

Claude Code's agent picker scans available agents by description. When VG's `/vg:build` skill body says "Spawn executor agent (one per plan task)" + dispatches with task lists, GSD's executor description pattern-matches strongly: "execute plan", "atomic commits", "checkpoint" — all phrases that appear in VG's build.md prose. The picker has historically preferred `gsd-executor` over `general-purpose` for these prompts.

V2.25.0's text fix said "NEVER spawn gsd-executor" but didn't explain WHY GSD wins by default, didn't mention the rule set differences, and didn't make the runtime check explicit. The AI dispatching waves saw a soft "should not" and continued routing through GSD when the picker scored it higher.

### Fix in this release

`commands/vg/build.md` step 7 (executor spawn) — replaced the soft "MANDATORY" block with a **HARD RULE — ZERO EXCEPTIONS** block that:

1. Lists the **specific** agent names to reject: `gsd-executor`, `gsd-execute-phase`, any `gsd-*` (except `gsd-debugger` used in step 12).
2. Explains **why the picker wants GSD**: agent ships globally at `~/.claude/agents/gsd-executor.md`, description matches plan-execution prompts.
3. Lists the **concrete rule-set differences** so the AI sees the cost:
   - VG forbids `--no-verify`; GSD allows it in parallel mode
   - VG requires `Per CONTEXT.md D-XX` body citation; GSD does not
   - VG L1-L6 design fidelity gates require structured evidence; GSD has none
   - VG enforces task context capsule with vision-decomposition; GSD doesn't load it
4. Names the **failure mode**: spawn GSD → GSD rule set wins → VG gates silently skip → downstream `/vg:review` + `/vg:test` fail with phantom artifacts.
5. Provides a **runtime self-check**: wave status line MUST read `general-purpose(Wave N Task M)`. If `gsd-executor(...)` appears, abort the spawn and re-spawn explicitly.

This is informational reinforcement — Claude Code does not expose a programmatic "force agent type" hook from skill body. The strongest defense is making the rule unambiguous + explaining the picker's failure mode + giving a runtime check the AI must perform.

### User action

After `/vg:update` to v2.26.0, the next `/vg:build` should dispatch `general-purpose(...)` consistently. If `gsd-executor(...)` still appears:

1. Confirm install version: `cat .claude/VGFLOW-VERSION` should be `2.26.0`. If not, `/vg:update` didn't apply (see #30, fixed v2.24.0 — re-update will work).
2. Check project CLAUDE.md for stale "gsd-executor spawned by /vg:build" prose — delete that section. Authority is build.md inline, not CLAUDE.md.
3. Reload Claude Code session — agent picker results cache per session.
4. If still misbehaving on v2.26.0+ with clean CLAUDE.md and fresh session: open a new issue with `claude --version` output + the dispatch line + a snippet of build.md step 7 from your install (to confirm the fix landed).

### Closed
N/A — user-reported follow-up to v2.25.0 doc fix; no separate issue filed.

## v2.25.0 (2026-04-28) — hooks python3 detection + gsd-executor doc fix

Closes #33 (hooks call `python` instead of `python3`) + clarifies executor agent type so AI doesn't pick `gsd-executor` when project's CLAUDE.md inherits a stale doc fragment.

### Issue #33 — hook commands fail on python3-only systems

`scripts/vg-hooks-install.py:HOOK_ENTRY` hard-coded `python` as the interpreter for all 4 hooks (Stop, PostToolUse Edit, PostToolUse Bash, UserPromptSubmit). On macOS Homebrew (default Python 3.x install) and many Linux distros, only `python3` is on PATH — no `python` symlink. All 4 hooks silently failed with `/bin/sh: python: command not found`. Script shebangs were correct (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`); only the bootstrap settings template was wrong.

**Fix:**
- New `_detect_python_cmd()` resolves at install time via `shutil.which`. Prefers `python3` (matches script shebangs), falls back to `python`, then literal `"python3"` if neither resolves.
- All 4 `HOOK_ENTRY` command strings use the detected name via f-string interpolation.
- `merge_hooks()` repair pass now also detects existing hook commands whose interpreter token doesn't resolve on PATH (e.g., a project installed on a Mac without `python` symlink) and repairs them in-place using the freshly-resolved name. Existing v2.5.2.4 unquoted-path repair preserved.

Affects new installs and any user re-running `bash sync.sh` or `python .claude/scripts/vg-hooks-install.py` on an existing project. Re-run after upgrading to land the repair.

### Stale `gsd-executor` reference (user reported)

User saw wave dispatch line `gsd-executor(Wave 3 Task 7 — Ledger posting service)` instead of expected `general-purpose(...)`. Root cause traced to `templates/vg/claude-md-executor-rules.md:13` which still read "gsd-executor spawned by /vg:build" — old prose from before v2.5.1's migration to general-purpose. Users who copy-pasted this template into their project CLAUDE.md gave their AI sessions an instruction that contradicted the actual `Agent(subagent_type="general-purpose", ...)` line in build.md, and the AI sometimes resolved the contradiction toward the doc instead of the dispatcher.

**Fix:**
- `templates/vg/claude-md-executor-rules.md` rewrites line 13 prose to "general-purpose subagent spawned by /vg:build" + adds explicit IMPORTANT block: "VG spawns general-purpose, NOT gsd-executor. Wrong agent type → stale install symptom (#30, fixed v2.24.0). Re-run /vg:update."
- `commands/vg/build.md` step 7 (executor spawn) prepends MANDATORY guard: "subagent_type MUST be general-purpose. NEVER spawn gsd-executor. If project's CLAUDE.md mentions gsd-executor, IGNORE it." Status line will read `general-purpose(Wave N Task M)` not `gsd-executor(...)`.

User action: paste the updated template block into project CLAUDE.md (or remove the old block — VG_EXECUTOR_RULES are also injected inline at every spawn so CLAUDE.md is no longer authoritative for them).

### Closed
- **#33** (this release — python3 detection + repair)

## v2.24.0 (2026-04-28) — silent update fix + cross-session zombie + is_stale tz bug

3 issues, 1 critical hidden bug. Closes #30, #32, partial #31.

### 1. `/vg:update` silent merge failure (#30, CRITICAL)

**User-visible symptom:** `/vg:update v2.12.7 → v2.23.0` reported `updated=526 new=3 conflicts=51` and rotated VGFLOW-VERSION cleanly. But none of the v2.20-v2.23 bug fixes actually landed in install files. User had to manually `cp` 51 files from `vgflow-ancestor/v2.23.0/` → `.claude/` to recover.

**Root cause:** `vg_update.py three_way_merge()` lines 78-85 — when ancestor missing AND current ≠ upstream, returned `MergeResult("conflict", cur_text)` (LOCAL content, not upstream). Caller in `update.md` step 6 wrote LOCAL as `.merged`, parked it as `.conflict`. `/vg:reapply-patches` saw zero markers and treated as resolved (or deleted as identical-to-local). Upstream content **never reached install**. Worst case: success-shaped UI, partial silent failure.

**Fix:**
- `three_way_merge()`: when ancestor missing AND current ≠ upstream, return `MergeResult("force-upstream", up_text)`. Without baseline, 3-way merge is impossible; user's intent in `/vg:update` is "give me new version" → take upstream as authoritative.
- `cmd_merge` exits 0 for both `clean` and `force-upstream` (caller mv `.merged` → target).
- `commands/vg/update.md` step 6: handles `force-upstream` status as a valid clean-apply path with distinct counter `FORCE_UPSTREAM`. Final summary now reads `updated=N new=M conflicts=K force_upstream=L skipped_meta=S` so user sees count of force-upgraded files. Pre-flight warns if `vgflow-ancestor/v${INSTALLED}/` missing.
- Verified: ancestor-missing fixture → returns `force-upstream`, output content == upstream verbatim. Ancestor-missing + current==upstream → `clean`. Ancestor exists with conflict → markers preserved.

### 2. Cross-session zombie blocks unrelated Stop hook (#32)

**User-visible symptom:** Session A `/vg:build 3.1` crashes without run-complete. Session B working on `/vg:blueprint 2` (different phase entirely) hits Stop hook → blocked by Session A's zombie active-run reporting Phase 3.1's missing telemetry/markers. User must manually `vg-orchestrator run-abort` after every turn. 3 zombie runs aborted in 1 day.

**Root cause:** `vg-verify-claim.py` Stop hook read `current-run.json` blindly without checking which session started the run. The orchestrator's "1 active run at a time" model was project-global, not session-scoped.

**Fix:**
- `vg-verify-claim.py`: new `get_run_session_id(run)` reads session_id from `current-run.json` first, falls back to sqlite query against runs table by run_id.
- Stop hook now branches on cross-session detection (when both sessions have IDs and they differ):
  - **Stale + cross-session** → auto-`run-abort` zombie via orchestrator + approve current Stop. Audit event emitted.
  - **Fresh + cross-session** → don't touch (might be parallel work) + approve current Stop without validating the other session's contract.
  - **Same-session OR unidentifiable** → existing logic preserved (OHOK-6 still blocks AI from gaming threshold).
- Verified 4 scenarios: stale+xsession → cleared, fresh+xsession → no-action, same+stale → BLOCK (OHOK-6 preserved), same+fresh → fall-through.

### 3. `is_stale()` always-True tz bug (PRE-EXISTING, surfaced during #32 work)

**Hidden bug found while testing #32:** `vg-verify-claim.py:is_stale()` and `vg-orchestrator __main__.py:_is_run_stale()` parsed `started_at` via `datetime.fromisoformat(started.rstrip("Z"))` → produces NAIVE datetime. Subtracting from `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` (AWARE) raised `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`. Except branch returned `True` → **is_stale() always returned True regardless of actual age**.

**Impact this caused:** Stop hook BLOCKED on every active run with the "stale" message even when 5 seconds old. Orchestrator's `run-start` auto-cleared every active run as "stale". Users lived with constant Stop hook blocks ascribed to "OHOK-6 threshold protection" but actually triggered by tz parse error.

**Fix:** Normalize `Z` → `+00:00` then add UTC tz if parser still returned naive. Aware-aware subtraction works → real age comparison.

### Closed
- **#30** (this release — force-upstream fix)
- **#32** (this release — cross-session detection + tz bug)
- **#31** — duplicate noise (sig 26ebcf1f, install_success info, vg=unknown). Same empty-context class as #24/#25/#29. Already fixed in v2.19.0 redact rewrite. Reporter v=unknown can't be on v2.19.0+; close as stale.

### Pipeline impact
- `/vg:update` users on stale-ancestor projects will now actually receive bug fixes instead of silently keeping old version
- Multi-session workflows on same project no longer interfere across phases
- Active-run age check now functions correctly (was always-stale-block before)

## v2.23.0 (2026-04-28) — CRUD validator BE-only fix (closes #26)

Backend-only phases in `web-fullstack` projects (wallet/ledger/billing/integration types) generated 270+ field-missing errors per resource at `/vg:blueprint` step 2d_validation_gate because `verify-crud-surface-contract.py` forced a `platforms.web` overlay even when the phase had zero FE work.

### Root cause

`_required_platforms("web-fullstack", phase_text)` checked `WEB_SIGNAL_RE` (matches `view|page|table|form|button|...`) against concatenated SPECS+CONTEXT+API-CONTRACTS+TEST-GOALS+PLAN text. Real BE-only phase docs contain those words in DB/API context — `"wallet table schema"`, `"form validation in handler"`, `"view permissions on /api/wallet/{id}"` — triggering false positives. Validator then required platforms.web for every resource and emitted ~270 missing-field violations per resource × 16 resources for fictional UI that won't exist until phase 6/8.

### Fix

Switched to a deterministic **file-path** signal sourced from `PLAN.md` (the post-blueprint task list cites concrete source paths):

- New `_plan_text(phase_dir)` helper reads `PLAN*.md` only (returns `None` if no PLAN exists yet).
- New `FE_SOURCE_PATH_RE` matches `apps/admin/`, `apps/merchant/`, `apps/vendor/`, `apps/web/`, `packages/ui/`, `packages/web-`, `frontend/`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`.
- `_required_platforms()` now branches:
  - **PLAN.md exists** → trust file paths over prose. Require `platforms.web` only when `FE_SOURCE_PATH_RE` matches PLAN. Always require `platforms.backend` when backend signals (API routes, handler, schema, migration) appear.
  - **No PLAN.md** (pre-blueprint phase) → fall back to legacy prose heuristic (preserves existing behavior on early-stage phases and the 5 existing tests).

### Test coverage
- `test_be_only_phase_in_fullstack_skips_web_overlay` — Reproduces #26: SPECS has FE-prose words from API/DB context, PLAN.md cites only `apps/api/` paths. With the fix: validator requires backend only, contract with backend overlay → PASS. Without the fix: would force web overlay → BLOCK with phantom missing fields.
- `test_fullstack_phase_with_fe_source_in_plan_requires_web` — Counter-test: PLAN.md cites `apps/admin/...Campaigns.tsx`, contract supplies only backend → BLOCK with `platforms.web overlay missing`.
- All 5 existing tests preserved (no PLAN.md fixture, falls back to legacy heuristic).

### Pipeline impact
- `/vg:blueprint` step 2d_validation_gate on BE-only phases of fullstack projects no longer emits phantom platforms.web requirements
- Phases affected on PrintwayV3 per reporter: 3.1 Wallet, 3.2 Topup, 3.3 Order Payment, 3.4a Team RBAC, 3.4b Credit, 3.5 Invoice, 4 Order Flow, 4.1 Net Terms, 5 Integrations, 11 Migration, 12 Competitive — all now author backend overlays only without contract thrash.

## v2.22.0 (2026-04-28) — events.db lock fix + datetime deprecation + crossai stderr separation

User reported: 2 concurrent /vg sessions in the **same project** collide on events.db. One session times out, its slash-command body continues running with no events emitted, Stop hook then reports a misleading runtime_contract violation (missing telemetry, missing markers). Plus a `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warning surfaces at every Stop hook on Python 3.12+.

### Root cause (lock issue)

`db.py` wrapped every event write in an advisory `_flock()` lockfile (`.vg/.events.lock`) on top of SQLite's WAL + busy_timeout. The advisory lock was redundant — WAL natively serializes writers — and worse, it added a second contention layer with its own 10s timeout and stale-detection logic. When session A held the file lock, session B raised `TimeoutError("flock held >10s")`. The orchestrator caller didn't surface this clearly; the slash-command continued, all subsequent emit-event calls also failed the file lock, and the run ended with **zero events written**. Stop hook saw empty events.db evidence → ran the runtime_contract checker → reported the symptom (violations) instead of the root cause (lock).

### Fix
- **`scripts/vg-orchestrator/db.py`** (and `.claude/` mirror):
  - Dropped the `_flock()` advisory lockfile entirely. No more `.vg/.events.lock`.
  - Switched `connect()` to `isolation_level=None` (autocommit mode) and bumped `busy_timeout` from 5000 → 30000ms.
  - Every write (`create_run`, `complete_run`, `append_event`) now wraps work in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` + `COMMIT` (or `ROLLBACK` on exception), acquiring the SQLite RESERVED lock at txn start instead of upgrading later. Eliminates SQLITE_BUSY upgrade races.
  - Added `_retry_locked(work, max_total_wait=60s)` Python-level safety net for residual lock errors (e.g., WAL checkpoint stalls). Surfaces a clear `TimeoutError` naming the likely cause when contention exceeds 60s — much better signal than the old "flock held >10s".
  - Updated stale comment in `vg-build-crossai-loop.py:345` ("serializes via _flock" → "serializes via SQLite BEGIN IMMEDIATE + busy_timeout").
- Stress-tested 8 concurrent threads × 10 writes each = 80 events total: 0 errors, hash chain valid. Old code would have timed out at least one thread after 10s.

### Other fixes

- **`datetime.utcnow()` deprecation** (Python 3.12+): replaced 46 occurrences across 13 files with timezone-aware `datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)`. Format strings preserve `Z` literal so output is byte-identical. Files: `bootstrap-test-runner`, `build-uat-narrative`, `design-reverse`, `distribution-check`, `generate-pentest-checklist`, `tests/test_verify_claim_hybrid`, `vg-build-crossai-loop`, `vg-entry-hook`, `vg-orchestrator/__main__`, `vg-step-tracker`, `vg-typecheck-hook`, `vg-verify-claim`, `vg-wired-check`. The `DeprecationWarning` user saw at every Stop hook now silent.

- **#27 — CrossAI stderr→stdout merge polluting verdict XML**: `commands/vg/_shared/crossai-invoke.md` line 99 redirected `2>&1` into `result-${cli.name}.xml`. When a CLI emitted large stderr (e.g., Codex CLI's TOML parser warnings on `~/.codex/agents/*.toml`), the XML file became 5000 lines of warnings followed by the actual verdict block; downstream parsers either matched the prompt's example XML (false-positive) or timed out. Split: stdout → `.xml`, stderr → `.err` (forensics-only, not parsed). Closes #27.

- **#28 — `vg-orchestrator override` text honesty**: Stop hook's "Fix options" block in `vg-orchestrator/__main__.py:3691` advertised option 2 as "logs to OVERRIDE-DEBT.md" without mentioning it does NOT bypass the validator on the current run. Users hit the gate, ran override, hit the same gate again — rationalization spiral. Hook text now reads: "logs OVERRIDE-DEBT.md entry ONLY. Does NOT bypass this run's runtime_contract violations. Stop hook will re-fire at next /vg command unless underlying evidence is produced. Use --skip-<validator> CLI flag at command invocation for per-run bypass." Real bypass-via-active-run-flag-consultation behavior deferred to v2.23+ (needs threat-modeling on what counts as "active run", what validators the override should disable, etc.). Partial-fix #28 (text-only); deeper fix tracked.

### Closed issues
- **#27** (this release — stderr separation)
- **#28** partial (this release — text honesty; deep fix deferred to v2.23+)
- **#24, #25** — duplicate noise from #29 (empty-context bug-reports). Already fixed in v2.19.0 (commit 46b4df8) which rewrote `bug_reporter_redact` to use a Python subprocess. Reporter on v2.18.0 needs to update.
- **#29** — same as #24/#25; redact bash parse error, fixed in v2.19.0 redact rewrite. User on v2.18.0 needs to update.

### Deferred
- **#26** — CRUD validator forces `platforms.web` overlay for BE-only phases. Real bug, bigger fix (validator must scan PLAN.md for FE patterns or honor `phase-profile.sh detect_phase_profile`). Defer to v2.23+ to avoid release thrash.

## v2.21.0 (2026-04-28) — Adversarial coverage Hook 1+3 (declarative threat model)

User asked: wire a step that writes tests for cheat / edge / error / lách-goals cases? Plan-mode pushback: NOT a separate step — it's a **cross-cutting concern** that belongs declaratively at goal definition (blueprint) and enforcement-wise at /vg:test. Step 2 of `.claude/plans/cheeky-mapping-engelbart.md`.

v2.21.0 ships **Hook 1 (schema)** + **Hook 3 (validator + test wiring)** lean. Hook 2 (codegen) deferred to v2.22+ once dogfood data shows which threat-types matter most per project domain.

### New
- **Hook 1 — `adversarial_scope` schema** in `commands/vg/_shared/templates/TEST-GOAL-enriched-template.md`. Per-goal threat declaration:
  ```yaml
  adversarial_scope:
    threats: [auth_bypass, injection, duplicate_submit]
    per_threat:
      auth_bypass:
        paths: ["other-tenant-id", "different-role", "expired-session"]
        assertions: ["status: 403 OR 404", "no PII leak in error body"]
      injection:
        payloads: ["${SQLI_PAYLOAD}", "${XSS_PAYLOAD}"]
        assertions: ["no payload execution"]
  ```
  Empty `threats: []` is an explicit decision, not a forgotten field — AI should comment why the goal is low-risk. Threat taxonomy v1: `auth_bypass`, `injection`, `race`, `duplicate_submit`, `boundary_overflow`, `role_escalation`, `csrf_replay`. New `adversarial_evidence` field at goal-bottom for /vg:test population.

- **Hook 3 — `verify-adversarial-coverage.py`** (`scripts/validators/`):
  - Rule 1: goal has `security_checks` block but no `adversarial_scope` → WARN (declare or set explicit `threats: []`)
  - Rule 2: `auth_model != public` AND `threats` missing both `auth_bypass`/`role_escalation` → WARN
  - Rule 3: `pii_fields` non-empty AND `threats` missing `injection` → WARN
  - Severity = warn (v1 dogfood-friendly). Promote to block via `vg.config.md → adversarial_coverage.severity = "block"`.
  - Override path: `--skip-adversarial=<reason>` (≥10 chars expected) — caller logs critical OVERRIDE-DEBT entry.
  - Smoke-tested 4 fixture goals: G-01 (security + adversarial both present, valid) → PASS; G-02 (security but no adversarial) → WARN missing-block; G-03 (no security_checks) → exempt; G-04 (PII without injection coverage) → WARN injection required.

- Registry entry `adversarial-coverage` (`scripts/validators/registry.yaml`): severity=warn, phases=[test, accept], domain=security, runtime=1500ms.

### Modified
- **`commands/vg/test.md` step 5d** — appended adversarial gate after the codegen→r7 console block. Reads `vg.config.md → adversarial_coverage.severity` (default warn). On WARN: prints findings, emits `test_adversarial_coverage_gap` telemetry, continues. On BLOCK + gap: exits 1 with override hint. `--skip-adversarial='<reason>'` flag forwarded to validator.

### Deferred to v2.22+ (Hook 2 — codegen)
- `commands/vg/_shared/templates/ADVERSARIAL-PAYLOAD-LIBRARY.md` (SQLI/XSS/SSTI/path-traversal/cmd-injection ready-to-use payloads)
- `commands/vg/_shared/templates/adversarial-spec.tmpl` (Playwright spec template per threat type)
- `scripts/vg_adversarial_codegen.py` engine (reads `adversarial_scope`, emits `<goal-id>.adversarial.<threat>.spec.ts`)
- `commands/vg/blueprint.md` Round 4 prompt extension nudging AI to populate `adversarial_scope`
- `commands/vg/accept.md` aggregator surfacing failed adversarial specs

### Why declarative-first
Adversarial coverage starts with intent ("what threats matter?"), not implementation ("here's a SQL payload"). Shipping the schema + WARN gate first lets phases declare threats during normal blueprint flow. Codegen ships next once we see real declarations to template against. This avoids generating spec scaffolding that doesn't match the 80% threat-shape across active projects.

### Pipeline impact
- `/vg:blueprint` — no behavior change (template available; AI may now emit `adversarial_scope` voluntarily)
- `/vg:test` step 5d — new WARN gate, default non-blocking. Override flag available
- `/vg:accept` — no aggregator yet (deferred); existing override-debt critical surfacing handles `--skip-adversarial` entries

## v2.20.0 (2026-04-28) — `/vg:polish` optional code-cleanup command

User asked: should code-clean / optimize be wired into the pipeline as a step after build / review / test / fix? Plan-mode pushback: NO, not as a gate. Reasons in `.claude/plans/cheeky-mapping-engelbart.md`:

1. Zero evidence vgflow-built code is dirty enough to warrant a hard gate. Building gates for non-existent problems is premature.
2. Each cleanup commit is a regression risk; gating means clean → re-test → re-clean loop in loop, 2-3× phase slowdown for 5% dirty-code reduction.
3. `simplify` skill (gstack) already covers the same need from user discretion.
4. "Polish" is a human judgement, not a gate-able rule (auto-extract a function may strip domain context, auto-rename may erase intent).

Shipped instead as **optional command** users invoke when ready:

### New
- **`/vg:polish`** (`commands/vg/polish.md` + `scripts/vg_polish.py`):
  - Modes: `--scan` (default, dry-run preview) | `--apply` (atomic commit per fix)
  - Levels: `--level=light` (default) — strip leftover `console.log`/`console.debug`/`console.info`, trailing whitespace. Safe: only touches code that cannot affect runtime. `--level=deep` adds warn-only signals (long functions >80 lines, empty if/else/catch blocks). v1 deep mode is warn-only — no auto-refactor.
  - Scope: `--scope=phase-N` | `--since=<sha>` | `--file=<path>`. Default = whole repo.
  - Per fix: read file, apply minimal edit, `git add` + `git commit -m "polish: <type> in <file>"`. Atomic — failure on one fix doesn't block others.
  - Reverse line-order apply per file so deletions don't shift indices for subsequent fixes in same file.
  - Working-tree-clean precondition (override with `--allow-dirty` for users mid-WIP).
  - Telemetry: `polish.started` / `polish.fix_applied` / `polish.completed`. Decide ROI from `/vg:telemetry --command=vg:polish` after a few months of dogfood; if useful, v3 may promote to gate.

### Detector smoke test (sample.ts fixture)
3 fix candidates + 2 warnings detected. Apply produces 2 atomic commits (1 fix per commit, deduplication via reverse-line ordering when overlap with trailing-whitespace on the same line). `console.error` correctly preserved (not in default delete list). Commented-out `console.log` correctly skipped.

### Deferred to v2.21+
- Unused imports / unused vars detector (needs language-aware tooling — eslint/ruff/tsc integration)
- Deep-mode auto-refactor (long-fn extraction, dup-block dedup) — v1 is warn-only
- `polish-helpers.sh` bash module (engine is Python; bash helpers not needed for v1)

### Pipeline impact
Zero. Pipeline (specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept) does NOT depend on `/vg:polish`. Accept gate unchanged. No new validators registered (opt-in only via `vg.config.md`).

## v2.19.0 (2026-04-28) — Bug squash + run-backfill subcommand (closes 14 issues)

Triage sweep of accumulated `bug-auto` queue surfaced 6 new issues + 1 PR same morning. Single commit-batch closes all of them plus 8 stale issues already fixed in prior versions. One new feature (`run-backfill`) earns the minor bump; everything else is fix.

### New
- **`vg-orchestrator run-backfill`** (`scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__.py`): documented path for emitting `run.completed` on legacy runs that predate Stop-hook contract enforcement (issue #21). Strict 5-condition guard: (1) `run.started` exists for `--run-id`, (2) no terminal event already, (3) command in supported set, (4) all required artifacts present in phase dir (mirrors `event-reconciliation` REQUIRED_ARTIFACTS), (5) `--reason` ≥ 10 chars. On success: emits `run.completed` with `payload.backfill=true` AND appends critical-severity entry to `OVERRIDE-DEBT.md` so the reviewer must triage at `/vg:accept`. Replaces the `db.append_event` bypass workaround that violated the forgery-detection guard.

### Fix
- **Registry YAML parse** (`scripts/validators/registry.yaml`): two `description:` entries had unquoted `: ` mid-string (line 747 + 889), breaking `yaml.safe_load` at line 747 col 310. Single-quote wrap restored 93/93 entry parse. The pre-existing failure was masking `validator-registry` from loading the catalog (`validate` / `list` returned 0 entries).
- **Commit-attribution regex** (#20, PR #23 by external contributor — merged): `CITATION_PATTERNS` accepted only literal `Per CONTEXT.md D-XX` / `Covers goal: G-XX`. 30+ real commits using natural variants (`implements P1.D-78`, `Goals G-100, G-141`, `G-W10-05`, `G-141.M1`) failed the gate. Relaxed to `\b(?:P[\d.]+\.)?D-(?:\d+|XX)\b` and `\bG-[\w.]+\b`. Phantom-ID detection downstream unchanged (still catches fabricated D/G IDs that don't resolve to real artifacts).
- **`bug-reporter.sh` redact + assignee** (#22, also closes #17 #18 noise + #7 verified): `sed 's|\\|/|g'` was malformed (bash double-quote ate one backslash → sed got `s|\|/|g` matching `|`, not `\`). Bash native `${x//\\//}` also failed under MSYS bash 5.2 glob matcher. Switched whole redact path to a Python subprocess — verified 6 cases (backslash + forward-slash paths, email, phase ID, plain text, empty, embedded quotes). Empty-data side-effect that collapsed sigs to `7467b7f1` resolved. `gh issue create --assignee=vietdev99` permission failures for external submitters now retry without `--assignee` so reports still land. Issue #7's arg-validation guard at lines 358-376 verified in place.
- **`override-resolve` ID format** (#19): orchestrator CLI writes register entries with `OD-NNN` IDs in YAML form; slash command regex only matched legacy table-format `DEBT-YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-PID`. Relaxed to `(DEBT-[0-9]+-[0-9]+|OD-[0-9]+|BF-[0-9]+-[0-9]+)`. Helper `override_resolve_by_id` now branches on ID prefix: YAML IDs → flip `status: active` + insert `resolved_at`/`resolved_event_id`/`resolution_reason` immediately after status (contiguous block); table IDs → unchanged path. The `BF-` flavor was added in the same commit batch for `run-backfill` debt entries.
- **Marker-walk repo root** (`scripts/validator-registry.py`, `scripts/tests/test_validator_registry.py`): both files used a fixed `parents[N]` index that resolved correctly only at install-target depth. Running canonical `scripts/...` directly walked one level outside the repo, so CLI silently reported 0 entries and pytest hit `JSONDecodeError`. Replaced with marker-walk searching upward for `VERSION` + `.git`. Verified canonical CLI now reports 93 entries; canonical pytest 12/12 pass; install-target pytest still 12/12.

### Closed
14 issues closed:
- **Active fixes:** #19, #20, #21, #22 (this release)
- **Verified existing:** #7 (arg-validation guard already present), #14 (wontfix-upstream — Claude Code core injects `<system-reminder>` at harness layer, no skill-side suppression API)
- **Duplicate noise:** #17, #18 (root cause = #22 redact bug, sigs collapsed to `7467b7f1`)
- **Stale fixes shipped in prior versions, verified on v2.18.0:** #3 (v1.11.1), #4 (v1.12.x migration), #6 (v1.12.2+ schema validation), #9 (v1.12.2+ bug-reporter), #10 #11 #12 #13 (all v1.14.1)

## v2.18.0 (2026-04-28) — Phase 20 Wave C: mobile mockup + reverse-engineer + Pencil validator

Wave C closes Phase 20 entirely. 3 decisions covering mobile design tooling, migration use-case (live URL → mockups), and Pencil output sanity.

- **D-13 — Sketch tool** (`scaffold-sketch.sh`): new entry `[i]` in tool selector. macOS-only manual export (`.png` from artboards). Mobile-friendly because Sketch ships built-in iOS/Android/watchOS artboard presets. Reuses `scaffold_wait_for_files` validation pattern from D-04. Decision matrix updated.
- **D-14 — `/vg:design-reverse`**: NEW command for migration projects. Playwright crawls a live URL + route list, captures PNG per route into `design_assets.paths/{slug}.png`. Cookies support for authenticated apps; viewport + `--full-page` flags. Output drops where `/vg:design-extract` consumes via `passthrough` handler — enables Phase 19 L1-L6 gates retroactively on projects with live UI but no design source files (the RTB use case). Companion script `scripts/design-reverse.py` with PASS / PARTIAL / BLOCK verdicts.
- **D-15 — `verify-pencil-output.py`**: defensive validator catching Pencil MCP `batch_design` syntax errors that produce 0-byte or wrong-format output silently. Heuristics: file ≥ 100 bytes; not PNG/JPG/HTML/JSON magic. Registered in `registry.yaml` as severity=block phase=scaffold. Smoke-tested 5 cases: missing / empty / PNG-format / random-200B-pass / no-entries-skip.

**Phase 20 final:** 15 decisions across 3 waves (D-01..D-12 Wave A, D-08..D-11 Wave B, D-13..D-15 Wave C). 10 tools supported (added Sketch in Wave C). 1 reverse-engineer command for migration. Both scaffold (greenfield) and reverse (live UI) directions covered.

**Coverage matrix:** greenfield ✅ (Wave A), tool diversity ✅ (8 Wave A + 1 Wave C), iteration loop with view-decomp ✅ (Wave B), migration ✅ (Wave C), output validation ✅ (Wave C). The only remaining gap is dogfood reliability measurement on real projects — process work, not code.

## v2.17.0 (2026-04-28) — Phase 20 Wave B: PenBoard auto + Claude design + v0 CLI + VIEW-COMPONENTS feedback

Wave B closes Phase 20. Promotes 2 stub tools to full implementation, conditionally automates 1 external tool, and wires the P19→P20 feedback loop.

- **D-08 — PenBoard MCP automated** (`scaffold-penboard.sh` full impl): agent prompt for `mcp__penboard__*` chain. Workspace mode — single `.penboard` file containing multi-page navigation, shared Sidebar/TopBar across pages, entity declarations, primary user flows via `mcp__penboard__write_flow`. ~$0.20/page Opus (heavier than Pencil due to MCP tool overhead).
- **D-09 — Claude design-shotgun integration** (`scaffold-claude-design.sh` full impl): detects `gstack:design-shotgun` skill via `~/.claude/skills/` glob. When present, emits orchestrator prompt for `/design-shotgun` (variants) + user pick + `/design-html` finalization chain. When absent, prints fallback message + ai-html alternative.
- **D-10 — v0 CLI conditional automation** (`scaffold-v0.sh` extension): detects `v0` CLI on PATH + auth via `v0 whoami`. Authenticated → drives `v0 generate --prompt --output --format html` per page, writes evidence with `v0_cli=true`. Else falls back to existing manual-export instructional.
- **D-11 — VIEW-COMPONENTS-aware mockup generation**: D-02 (Pencil MCP) and D-03 (AI HTML) prompts now detect `${PHASE_DIR}/VIEW-COMPONENTS.md` (P19 D-02 vision-decomposition output). When present, per-slug component list becomes AUTHORITATIVE input — every component must appear in mockup output. Closes the P19↔P20 feedback loop: vision decomposition spec → scaffold consumes → tighter mockups → P19 L1-L6 verify against tighter ground truth.

**Backward compatibility:** D-11 gates by file presence — projects without P19 D-02 baseline (first scaffold pass) get original prompts unchanged.

Phase 20 fully shipped. All 12 decisions (D-01..D-12) implemented across Wave A (v2.16.0) + Wave B (v2.17.0). Future tracking: dogfood reliability measurement on greenfield phase, mobile-specific mockup tools (Sketch/Marvel), reverse-engineering live UI to mockups (separate phase).

## v2.16.0 (2026-04-28) — Phase 20 Wave A: greenfield design scaffold

Closes the upstream gap exposed by Phase 19. Greenfield projects (zero design assets) bypassed every L1-L6 gate via Form B `no-asset:` and shipped AI-imagined UI. Wave A delivers an entry command, blueprint pre-flight gate, and 8-tool selector covering Pencil MCP / PenBoard MCP / AI HTML / Claude design / Stitch / v0 / Figma / manual.

- **D-01 — `/vg:design-scaffold` entry command** with `--tool=<id>` selector + decision matrix (`--help-tools`). Default `pencil-mcp` per user choice. Bulk by default + `--interactive` flag for per-page review pause.
- **D-02 — Pencil MCP automated** (`scaffold-pencil.sh`): spawns Opus with `mcp__pencil__batch_design` + DESIGN.md tokens, output `.pen` files for `pencil_mcp` handler.
- **D-03 — AI HTML automated** (`scaffold-ai-html.sh`): Opus emits HTML+Tailwind from DESIGN.md tokens; L-002 anti-pattern explicitly banned in prompt; output `.html` for `playwright_render` handler.
- **D-03b — Auto-regen on DESIGN.md change** (`scaffold-staleness-check.py`): caches by DESIGN.md SHA256 in `.scaffold-evidence/<slug>.json`; mismatch → mark stale → re-run.
- **D-04 — 4 instructional sub-flows**: `scaffold-stitch.sh` (Google Stitch), `scaffold-v0.sh` (Vercel v0), `scaffold-figma.sh` (Figma), `scaffold-manual.sh` (hand-written HTML). Print tool-specific instructions + `scaffold_wait_for_files` validation loop with [c]ontinue/[s]kip/[a]bort prompts.
- **D-05 — `/vg:specs` proactive suggestion**: after SPECS committed, soft-prints `/vg:design-system + /vg:design-scaffold` recommendations when FE work + missing tokens/mockups.
- **D-06 — Greenfield Form B critical block at `/vg:accept`**: extends step 3c with `verify-override-debt-threshold.py --kind 'design-greenfield-*' --threshold 1` — ANY single greenfield Form B BLOCKs accept until resolved via scaffold or rationalization-guard.
- **D-12 — Blueprint pre-flight design discovery (NEW per user request 2026-04-28)**: new step 0_design_discovery in `/vg:blueprint` — detects FE work + zero mockups, AskUserQuestion routes 5 options ([a]existing path, [b]external tool, [c]scaffold, [d]explicit skip with critical debt, [skip]one-time bypass). Re-checks after a/b/c. Config gate `design_discovery.enabled` (default true). Closes the silent-skip risk that D-05 soft suggestion alone can't prevent.

**Wave B deferred (v2.17.0):** D-08 PenBoard MCP automation, D-09 Claude design-shotgun integration, D-10 v0 CLI hook, D-11 VIEW-COMPONENTS-aware scaffold (P19 D-02 feedback loop).

**Tool stubs in Wave A:** `scaffold-penboard.sh` and `scaffold-claude-design.sh` print Wave B deferral message + manual workaround.

**Codex mirror count:** 61 → 62 (added `vg-design-scaffold`).

## v2.15.3 (2026-04-28) — CI hard-gate on codex mirror drift (closes #16 process gap)

Patch release. Closes the process gap that allowed v2.15.0–v2.15.1 to ship stale codex mirrors. No code behaviour change.

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` now runs `verify-codex-mirror-equivalence.py` between Setup Python and Build tarball steps. If any of 61 mirror pairs is functionally non-equivalent to canonical after adapter strip, the release fails with a clear remediation sequence (regen + commit + delete-and-retag).
- Pre-2.13.0 tags get a graceful skip (verifier file absent in early tags).
- Effect: any future canonical change (`commands/vg/*.md`) without matching `generate-codex-skills.sh --force` will block tagging at CI time. No silent shipped drift possible.

This is the third option from the recommendation set in CHANGELOG v2.15.2 — chosen over post-commit hook (#2) and pre-tag git hook (#3) because it cannot be bypassed by skipping local hooks.

## v2.15.2 (2026-04-28) — Codex mirror regen (fixes #16)

Patch release closing #16. v2.15.1 release tarball shipped stale `codex-skills/*/SKILL.md` mirrors because Phase 19 commits (v2.13.0–v2.15.0) modified canonical `commands/vg/{accept,blueprint,build,review}.md` without re-running `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh`. `/vg:sync --verify` after standard-install upgrade reported 5 functional drifts.

- Re-ran generator with `--force`; verifier reports 61/61 pairs OK (zero functional drift after adapter strip).
- 4 mirrors regenerated: vg-accept (+74 lines for D-06), vg-blueprint (+196 for D-01+D-02+D-03), vg-build (+343 for L1+L2+L3+L5+L6 gates), vg-review (+117 for phase 2.5 sub-step 6e).
- Process gap noted: codex mirror regen should auto-fire on canonical change, or be enforced by pre-release CI. Tracking as follow-up; until then, `generate-codex-skills.sh --force` must run before any release tag.

## v2.15.1 (2026-04-28) — Validator registry catch-up (install/update propagation)

Patch release. No behaviour change — closes the catalog gap so the new gates from v2.13.0–v2.15.0 surface in `/vg:validators`, `/vg:doctor`, `/vg:gate-stats`, and the validator-drift check.

- 9 catalog entries added to `scripts/validators/registry.yaml`: `layout-fingerprint`, `build-visual`, `design-ref-coverage` (v2.13.0); `ui-spec-scan-coverage`, `view-decomposition`, `vision-self-verify`, `override-debt-threshold` (v2.14.0); `read-evidence`, `component-scope` (v2.15.0). Each entry declares severity, phases_active, domain, runtime_target_ms, added_in, and one-line description per registry schema.
- `install.sh` and `/vg:update` mechanisms verified to deploy the new artifacts without changes:
  - Fresh `install.sh` smoke landed all 9 new validators + `verify-build-visual.py` + `commands/vg/_shared/design-fidelity-guard.md` + commit-msg hook with D-08 citation gate.
  - `/vg:update` step 6 maps `scripts/*` → `.claude/scripts/*` and uses straight-copy (NEW_FILES path) for files absent locally; modified files use existing 3-way merge.
- No code change to install.sh / update.md was required — recursive `cp` patterns and path-mapping case statements already handle the new files.

## v2.15.0 (2026-04-28) — Closing Phase 19: cryptographic Read evidence + fine-grained planner

Closes the two items v2.14.0 left open. With this release, every Phase 19 decision (D-01 through D-09) has shipped or is documented research.

- **D-09 — read-evidence sentinel with PNG SHA256 (L6 build gate)**: promoted from RESEARCH.md to a shipped gate. Executor MUST Write `.read-evidence/task-${N}.json` after Read PNG, declaring the SHA256 of every file Read at that moment. New `verify-read-evidence.py` re-hashes every declared PNG; mismatch = BLOCK. Cryptographically infeasible to fabricate (search space 2^256), so this is the strongest "prove you Read it" gate available without runtime hook transcript surface. Wired in `build.md` step 9 after L5; off by default via `visual_checks.read_evidence.enabled` until executor rule rollout.
- **D-04 — fine-grained planner component-scope (FEATURE-FLAGGED)**: planner Rule 9 added. When `planner.fine_grained_components.enabled=true` AND `VIEW-COMPONENTS.md` exists (D-02 output), planner decomposes one-page tasks into N tasks per top-level component (`child_count >= 3` OR `position area >= 20% viewport`). New `<component-scope>{Name}</component-scope>` task field. New `verify-component-scope.py` blocks at /vg:build step 9 when staged files fall outside the declared scope and aren't explicitly listed in `<file-path>`. NO-OPS on tasks without the tag → fully backward compatible with v2.14.0 PLAN files.

**Config additions:**
- `visual_checks.read_evidence.enabled` (D-09)
- `planner.fine_grained_components.enabled` (D-04)

**Phase 19 status — final:**

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| D-01 scan.json into UI-SPEC | ✅ shipped v2.14.0 |
| D-02 view-decomposition step 2b6c | ✅ shipped v2.14.0 |
| D-03 cross-AI gap-hunt | ✅ shipped v2.14.0 |
| D-04 fine-grained planner | ✅ shipped v2.15.0 (flagged) |
| D-05 vision-self-verify (L5) | ✅ shipped v2.14.0 |
| D-06 manual UAT 3-file diff | ✅ shipped v2.14.0 |
| D-07 override-debt threshold | ✅ shipped v2.14.0 |
| D-08 commit-msg citation | ✅ shipped v2.14.0 |
| D-09 sentinel-with-hash (L6) | ✅ shipped v2.15.0 |

Combined ladder reaches the practical reliability ceiling: ~95% with all default-on layers, ~97% with D-04+D-09 enabled and dogfood-tuned.

## v2.14.0 (2026-04-28) — Design fidelity 95%: upstream view-decomp + downstream vision guard + forcing functions

Phase 19 minor release. Closes the residual gap after v2.13.0's 4-layer pixel pipeline + L-002 mandate. Eight decisions (D-01 through D-09; D-04 deferred), three implementation waves. AI alone never reaches 100%, but the combined stack now meaningfully approaches 95% reliability on dogfood phases.

**Wave A — cheap, high leverage:**
- **D-01 — `scan.json` consumed in UI-SPEC**: blueprint step 2b6 now reads `${DESIGN_OUT}/scans/{slug}.scan.json` for every `<design-ref>` slug. Modals/forms/tabs discovered by Layer 2 Haiku must surface in UI-SPEC.md `## Modals` / `## Forms` / `## Per-Page Layout`. New `verify-ui-spec-scan-coverage.py` blocks if the agent silently dropped scan findings.
- **D-05 — vision-self-verify (Lớp 5)**: separate-model adjudication at /vg:build step 9. Spawns Haiku zero-context with the design PNG + commit diff + VIEW-COMPONENTS row, gets PASS/FLAG/BLOCK on whether expected components actually appear in the JSX. Closes the gap where pixel-similar UI passes L3/L4 SSIM yet misses components entirely. New `verify-vision-self-verify.py` + `design-fidelity-guard.md` skill. Off by default (config gate); ~$0.001/task Haiku when enabled.
- **D-06 — manual UAT 3-file diff**: /vg:accept Section D now surfaces `baseline.png` + `current.png` + `diff.png` side-by-side when L4 SSIM produced a diff. User picks `[f]` → phase rejected with `kind=human-rejected-design` debt; AI cannot bypass interactive prompt.

**Wave B — vision upstream:**
- **D-02 — view-decomposition step 2b6c**: blueprint inserts a step BEFORE UI-SPEC that spawns vision-capable Opus per `<design-ref>` slug to Read the PNG and emit canonical `VIEW-COMPONENTS.md` (semantic component list with positions). New `verify-view-decomposition.py` blocks generic names (div/Container/Wrapper alone), enforces minimum 3 components per slug. Off by default — opt-in via `design_assets.view_decomposition.enabled`.
- **D-03 — cross-AI gap-hunt**: same step 2b6c gets a second adversarial pass with a DIFFERENT model (per `vg.config.crossai_clis`) asking "what did Layer 1 miss?". Reuse of `vg-design-gap-hunter` pattern. ≥2 missed → re-spawn Layer 1 with reminder, max 1 iteration.

**Wave C — forcing functions, closing back doors:**
- **D-07 — design override-debt threshold gate**: /vg:accept step 3c new sub-gate. Blocks accept when ≥N (default 2) unresolved `kind=design-*` entries exist in OVERRIDE-DEBT.md. Caps the stacking of `--skip-design-pixel-gate` / `--skip-fingerprint-check` / `--skip-build-visual` / `--allow-design-drift`. New `verify-override-debt-threshold.py` (count-based, fnmatch glob filter — distinct from age-based SLA validator).
- **D-08 — commit-msg design citation gate**: extends `templates/vg/commit-msg` hook. FE files staged without `Per design/{slug}.png` OR `Design: no-asset (reason)` OR `Design: refactor-only` get rejected at commit boundary. PR #15 L-002 rule moves from convention to hard gate. Independent of `commit_msg_hook.enabled`; gated by `design_citation.enabled` (default true). Pure-rename commits bypass.

**Research only:**
- **D-09 — transcript verification feasibility**: documented in `dev-phases/19-design-fidelity-95-pct-v1/RESEARCH.md`. Direct subagent transcript inspection is NOT feasible with current Claude Code surface (`SubagentStop` returns final output text only, no `tool_calls` payload). Sentinel-file-with-PNG-SHA256 fallback is implementable now but deferred — L1+L2+L5+L6 already meet the 95% target without it.

**Deferred:**
- **D-04 — fine-grained planner re-emit from VIEW-COMPONENTS** marked HIGH risk in plan; would change planner output shape and break existing PLAN fixtures. Skipped this release; revisit after dogfood validates VIEW-COMPONENTS quality.

**Config additions:**
- `visual_checks.vision_self_verify.{enabled,model,timeout_s}` (D-05)
- `design_assets.view_decomposition.{enabled,model,min_components_per_slug}` (D-02)
- `override_debt.design_threshold` (D-07)
- `design_citation.enabled` (D-08)

**Reliability ladder (anecdotal estimate):**

| Stack | Reliability |
|---|---|
| Pre-v2.13 (prompt + manual UAT only) | ~30% |
| v2.13.0 (4 layers + L-002) | ~70% |
| v2.14.0 Wave A (D-01 + D-05 + D-06) | ~85% |
| v2.14.0 full (Wave A + B + C) | ~95% |
| v2.14.0 + D-09 sentinel-with-hash (future) | ~97% |
| 100% | impossible — AI is stochastic |

## v2.13.0 (2026-04-28) — Design pixel fidelity pipeline (4 layers) + L-002 planner mandate

Minor release closing the silent-skip gap where AI-built UI shipped generic Tailwind despite a phase having a complete design folder. Four stacked gates so a slip in any one layer is caught by the next, plus a planner-side coverage validator.

- **L-002 lesson — `<design-ref>` mandate (PR #15):** `vg-planner-rules.md` Rule 8 makes `<design-ref>` MANDATORY for FE tasks (file-path matches `apps/{admin,merchant,vendor,web}/**`, `packages/ui/src/{components,theme}/**`, or extension `.tsx/.jsx/.vue/.svelte`). Two emit forms — Form A (slug from `manifest.json`), Form B (`no-asset:{reason}` for explicit gaps, never silent). `vg-executor-rules.md` "Design fidelity" rewritten: Read each PNG via Read tool, cite `Per design/{slug}.png` in commit body, anti-pattern `flex items-center justify-center` for authenticated pages explicitly named.
- **L1 — design-pixel hard-gate at executor spawn:** `pre-executor-check.py` now emits absolute `design_image_paths` + `design_image_required`; `/vg:build` step 8c verifies every required PNG exists on disk before spawning the executor. Override `--skip-design-pixel-gate` (logged to override-debt). Architect L2 prompt template gets the same vision injection rule.
- **L2 — LAYOUT-FINGERPRINT forcing function:** new `verify-layout-fingerprint.py` validator at `/vg:build` step 9 requires `.fingerprints/task-N.fingerprint.md` with H2 sections Grid/Spacing/Hierarchy/Breakpoints (>=60 chars each) before code commits for any `<design-ref>` slug task. Override `--skip-fingerprint-check`.
- **L3 — build-time visual gate:** new `verify-build-visual.py` renders each `<design-ref>` task via headless Playwright + pixelmatches against the design baseline at `/vg:build` step 9. Auto-SKIPs cleanly when dev server / Node / pixelmatch is missing - projects without the harness are not blocked. Override `--skip-build-visual` for real diffs.
- **L4 — design-fidelity SSIM at review:** `/vg:review` phase 2.5 sub-step 6e SSIM-checks every `RUNTIME-MAP` view with a `design_ref` slug, BLOCK on threshold breach. Override `--allow-design-drift` consumes a rationalization-guard slot.
- **PR #15 follow-up — coverage validator:** new `verify-design-ref-coverage.py` walks every PLAN.md task; classifies FE vs non-FE; BLOCKs on missing `<design-ref>`, slug not in manifest, or Form B without reason. WARNs (skips slug validation) when manifest absent; `--strict` promotes WARN to BLOCK for CI.
- **Config:** `design_fidelity_threshold_pct` added to `visual_checks`; `dev_server_url` + `visual_threshold_pct` added to `build_gates`. Both `vg.config.template.md` (top-level) and `templates/vg/vg.config.template.md` (token version) updated.

## v2.12.7 (2026-04-28) — Runtime CSS asset verification

Patch release for a real UI failure class: built pages linking CSS URLs that return source code, HTML, or the wrong MIME type.

- Added `verify-static-assets-runtime.py`, a live probe that opens `VG_TARGET_URL`, discovers `<link rel="stylesheet">`, fetches each stylesheet, and blocks if it is not served as `text/css`.
- The validator also blocks stylesheet bodies that look like HTML/JS/TS source even when the header claims `text/css`.
- Wired the validator into `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, and `/vg:accept`; it auto-skips when no live target URL is available and is unquarantinable when active.
- Added regression tests for valid CSS, wrong `Content-Type`, source-code body, no-target auto-skip, and orchestrator/registry wiring.

## v2.12.6 (2026-04-28) — Context capsules + Codex test-goal lane

Feature release for reducing AI lazy-read/context miss risk before build.

- `/vg:build` now writes a deterministic per-task context capsule from `pre-executor-check.py` and injects it into each executor prompt before the long context blocks.
- Added `verify-task-context-capsule.py` as an unquarantinable build validator so a resolved task/API/goals/CRUD/security context cannot pass unless the executor prompt actually received the capsule.
- `/vg:blueprint` now adds step `2b5a_codex_test_goal_lane`: Codex produces `TEST-GOALS.codex-proposal.md`, then `test-goal-delta.py` compares it against final `TEST-GOALS.md`.
- Added `verify-codex-test-goal-lane.py` so unresolved proposal deltas block blueprint handoff unless explicitly skipped with override debt.
- Regenerated Codex skill mirrors and added regression tests for capsule generation, prompt injection, Codex goal deltas, and workflow wiring.

## v2.12.5 (2026-04-28) — Graphify install/update verification

Patch release for Graphify environment bootstrap.

- Added `ensure-graphify.py` as the shared installer/updater check for Graphify.
- `install.sh`, `sync.sh`, and `/vg:update` now verify/repair Graphify when `graphify.enabled=true`.
- Missing Graphify installs `graphifyy[mcp]`; project `.mcp.json`, `.graphifyignore`, and `.gitignore` are repaired without forcing an initial graph build.
- Added regression tests for helper behavior and install/sync/update wiring.

## v2.12.4 (2026-04-28) — Build Graphify refresh enforcement

Patch release for stale/missing Graphify build context.

- `/vg:build` now cold-builds Graphify when `graphify.enabled=true` but `graphify-out/graph.json` does not exist yet.
- `/vg:build` refreshes Graphify after each successful build wave and once more before final run-complete.
- Graphify rebuilds now emit `graphify_auto_rebuild` into `.vg/events.db`, not only best-effort telemetry.
- Added `build-graphify-required` as an unquarantinable build validator so enabled + installed Graphify cannot pass without current-run rebuild evidence.

## v2.12.3 (2026-04-27) — Playwright MCP install/update verification

Patch release for environment bootstrap reliability.

- Added `verify-playwright-mcp-config.py` to check and repair Claude + Codex Playwright MCP workers (`playwright1`..`playwright5`).
- `install.sh`, `sync.sh`, and `/vg:update` now verify/repair Playwright MCP config instead of assuming user settings are already correct.
- Replaced stale hardcoded Playwright lock-manager paths with runtime `${HOME}` / `VG_PLAYWRIGHT_LOCK_DIR` resolution.
- Added regression tests for stale copied settings, fake-HOME install/sync, and `/vg:update` MCP repair wiring.

## v2.12.2 (2026-04-27) — Review CrossAI evidence gate

Patch release for objective review enforcement.

- `/vg:review` now requires `${PHASE_DIR}/crossai/review-check.xml` when CrossAI is not explicitly skipped.
- `/vg:review` now requires `crossai.verdict` telemetry when CrossAI is not explicitly skipped.
- `--skip-crossai` in review now requires override-debt evidence, matching blueprint behavior.
- Added regression tests so review CrossAI cannot regress to marker-only theatre.

## v2.12.1 (2026-04-27) — Build CrossAI completion semantics

Patch release for a misleading `/vg:build` completion signal.

- Changed `/vg:build` step 9 to report "code execution complete" instead of "build complete" before CrossAI runs.
- Moved `build.completed` telemetry to step 12 after the CrossAI build verification loop reaches an accepted terminal state.
- Kept `PIPELINE-STATE.steps.build` as `in_progress` while CrossAI/run-complete are pending, then marks it `done` only after run-complete passes.
- Added regression tests to prevent future pre-CrossAI completion claims.

## v2.12.0 (2026-04-27) — Platform-aware CRUD Surface Contract

Feature release for the "AI must not lazy-read blueprint" problem.

- Added `CRUD-SURFACES.md` as the parent resource contract for list/read/create/update/delete surfaces. Existing paging/list/filter/security notes now extend this contract instead of living as loose prose.
- Added `schemas/crud-surface.v1.json` and `verify-crud-surface-contract.py`. The gate blocks CRUD/resource phases that miss base business-flow/security/abuse/perf invariants or the required web/mobile/backend overlay.
- Wired blueprint to generate `CRUD-SURFACES.md`; build to inject the relevant resource slice into executor prompts; review/test/accept to validate against the same contract.
- Added platform-aware config defaults. Web phases check table/filter/search/sort/pagination/form/delete behavior, mobile phases check deep-link/pull-to-refresh/tap-target/offline states, backend phases check query allowlists, authz, mass-assignment, idempotency, audit log, and performance budget.
- Added regression tests for validator behavior, executor context injection, and command/orchestrator wiring.

## v2.11.1 (2026-04-27) — Phase 16 hot-fix (cross-AI consensus 6-BLOCKer rework)

Hot-fix release. Phase 16 "Task Fidelity Lock" was shipped at HEAD between
v2.11.0 and v2.12.0 cut, but a 3-way cross-AI review (Claude Opus 4.7
internal + Codex GPT-5.5 peer) found 6 BLOCKers — including a CRITICAL
foundational design flaw that defeated the entire phase goal. Hot-fixed
in 9 atomic commits before any release tag bumped past v2.11.0.

### Cross-AI consensus BLOCKers fixed

**B1 (CRITICAL)** — `verify-task-fidelity.py` only compared LINE COUNTS,
not content hashes. Codex verified: replacing every body line with
"PARAPHRASED LINE N" at identical line count returned PASS. The exact
failure mode Phase 16 was designed to block.

**B2** — `build.md` step 8c persisted UI-MAP+DESIGN-REF wrapper to
`${TASK_NUM}.md`, NOT the task body. Audit compared wrapper line count
vs meta's body line count → false BLOCK on every UI task on first real
`/vg:build`. Test fixture bypassed by writing body directly to disk.

**B3** — Both meta + prompt persist were gated on UI conditional. Backend
tasks (no UI subtree, no design context) got NO meta.json → audit silent
PASS → orchestrator could paraphrase backend task bodies freely.

**B4** — `pre-executor-check.py main()` used legacy v1 extract for
`task_context` while v2 was called separately for meta. XML PLAN tasks
returned `"Task N not found in PLAN files"` sentinel as task_context
while meta reported `source_format=xml`. Two extraction sources → drift.

**B5** — `verify-task-schema.py` + `verify-crossai-output.py` were
registered in `registry.yaml` with `phases_active: [scope, blueprint]`
but NEVER invoked from any skill body. Registry tagging is documentation,
not orchestration. Tests passed because they called validators via
subprocess directly, never via `/vg:blueprint` flow.

**B6** — `verify-crossai-output.py` diff parser only matched XML
`<task id="N">`. SPECS D-02 explicitly says current PLANs are in heading-
format transition. Codex verified: 50-line prose addition to `## Task N:`
heading PLAN without `<context-refs>` returned silent PASS.

### Hot-fix commits (9 atomic, ordered)

- C1 `b70e600` — `pre-executor-check.py main()`: switch to
  `extract_task_section_v2()["body"]` as single source for task_context
  and task_meta. v1 stays as legacy shim.
- C2 `f88853a` — `verify-crossai-output.py`: `_classify_diff_lines_per_task`
  also matches `## Task N:` headings; tracks scope from BOTH formats.
- C3 `f071bd8` — `build.md` step 8c split persist: always write
  `${TASK_NUM}.body.md` + `${TASK_NUM}.meta.json`; UI conditional now
  writes `${TASK_NUM}.uimap.md` separately. `verify-uimap-injection.py`
  glob updated; `verify-task-fidelity.py` reads `*.body.md` primary.
- C4 `2d8d561` (CRITICAL) — `verify-task-fidelity.py` adds
  `task_block_sha256(prompt_text)` compare. Hash mismatch ALWAYS BLOCKs;
  shortfall_pct only classifies the kind (truncation vs paraphrase).
- C5 `f495f0d` — `blueprint.md` sub-step 2d-3c added: invokes
  `verify-task-schema.py` (always) + `verify-crossai-output.py` (gated
  `--crossai`).
- C6 `43149c7` — `scope.md` step 4: invokes `verify-crossai-output.py`
  after CrossAI peer review (gated `--crossai`).
- C7 `ea75c92` — `vg-orchestrator/__main__.py` `COMMAND_VALIDATORS`:
  `vg:blueprint += [verify-task-schema, verify-crossai-output]`,
  `vg:scope += [verify-crossai-output]`. Defense-in-depth alongside
  skill body invocations.
- C8 `d55d2af` — 11 production-path regression tests (5 new test
  classes) covering each of the 6 BLOCKers. Codex's exact paraphrase
  attack now BLOCKed by `test_same_line_paraphrase_blocks_as_content_paraphrase`.
- C9 (this) — VERSION 2.11.0 → 2.11.1, CHANGELOG entry.

### Test count delta

- v2.11.0: 207 passed, 1 skipped (P15: 100, P16: 43, P17: 64)
- v2.11.1: 218 passed, 1 skipped (P15: 100, P16: 54, P17: 64). +11 tests.

### Test semantic update

- `TestPhase16TaskFidelity::test_minor_truncation_passes` was renamed to
  `test_minor_truncation_blocks_by_hash` and the assertion flipped from
  PASS to BLOCK. The original test encoded the buggy line-count-only
  behavior that allowed silent content drift up to 10%. After C4, ANY
  content drift = hash mismatch = BLOCK as content_paraphrase.

### Cross-AI review artifacts

Full review reports kept for audit trail:
- `dev-phases/16-task-fidelity-lock-v1/REVIEW-CROSSAI.md` (Claude Opus 4.7
  internal review — found 3 BLOCKers + 6 WARNs; missed B1 and B6)
- `dev-phases/16-task-fidelity-lock-v1/crossai/result-codex.md` (Codex
  GPT-5.5 peer review — found 5 BLOCKers + 4 WARNs; verified B1 and B6
  with negative tests)
- `dev-phases/16-task-fidelity-lock-v1/crossai/prompt.md` (the prompt
  both reviewers received — for reproducibility)

Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview was attempted as a third reviewer but Cloud Code
Assist OAuth quota retrieve fail (`PERMISSION_DENIED`) blocked invocation.
Skipped without affecting consensus (Claude+Codex agreement was already
HIGH confidence).

### Key takeaway for future phases

Acceptance tests must exercise the actual /vg pipeline path, not just
helper functions in isolation. C8 `TestPhase16Hotfix*` classes are the
new template: assert on production code paths (build.md text, skill
body invocations, orchestrator dispatch dict), not just on validator
behavior in subprocess isolation.

## v2.11.0 (2026-04-27) — Phase 17 ship + extraction-quality polish + orphan validator wire

Minor release combining 3 layers of work that surfaced from Phase 15
dogfood + Phase 17 cross-AI review:

### Phase 17 — Test Session Reuse (D-01..D-06)

User observation in Phase 7.14.3 RTB: test dashboard window opens many
times → wall-clock + resource waste. Phase 15 D-16 (10 spec files per
filter+pagination control) multiplies the cost — must fix before
consumer dogfood at scale.

Shipped:
- `commands/vg/_shared/templates/interactive-helpers.template.ts` — extended
  with `loginOnce(role, opts?)` (auto/api/ui strategy with TTL +
  config_hash invalidation) + `useAuth(role)` (Playwright fixture
  override) + `LoginOnceOptions` interface. Backward-compat preserved
  (`loginAs` legacy export untouched).
- `commands/vg/_shared/templates/playwright-global-setup.template.ts` +
  `playwright-config.partial.ts` — global setup template + merge
  fragment so consumer's playwright.config.ts wires globalSetup once.
- 10 Phase 15 D-16 templates updated: `test.use(useAuth(ROLE))` replaces
  `test.beforeEach(loginAs(page, ROLE))`. Login flows go from O(N spec
  files) to O(M roles).
- `vg.config.template.md` extended with `test:` block (storage_state_path,
  ttl_hours, playwright.workers, fully_parallel, login_strategy).
- `commands/vg/test.md` step 5d-pre auto-setup: detect E2E dir, copy
  global-setup.ts, export VG_STORAGE_STATE_PATH/VG_STORAGE_STATE_TTL_HOURS/
  VG_LOGIN_STRATEGY env vars, append `.auth/` to `.gitignore`,
  discover VG_ROLES from vg.config accounts.
- `scripts/validators/verify-test-session-reuse.py` (D-06): WARN on
  generated specs still using legacy beforeEach(loginAs); --strict mode
  escalates to BLOCK.

53 acceptance tests + 18 helper smoke tests across 6 dimensions.

### P17 polish — cross-AI review hotfix (5 WARN findings)

W-1 useAuth pre-check storage state file existence (cryptic ENOENT → console.warn pointing at root cause).
W-2 _loginViaApi validate cookies > 0 (server 200 with no Set-Cookie no longer pollutes 24h cache with empty file).
W-5 broaden cross-phase regression glob `1[57]` → `1[5-9]` (catch P16/P18+ when added).

W-3 (validator backtick edge case) + W-4 (awk YAML indent fragility) deferred — both rare, non-blocking.

### Self-audit hotfix — orphan validators wired + extraction bugs fixed

User raised concern (Q1): "long blueprint → AI lazy-read, miss content
→ build code thiếu". Self-audit found this concern was already addressed
in code BUT validators never fired:

- `verify-blueprint-completeness.py` — META-GATE for GOAL↔PLAN coverage
  (C1) + ENDPOINT↔GOAL coverage (C2 incl auth_path/happy/4xx/401)
- `verify-test-goals-platform-essentials.py` — Phase 7.14.3 retrospective
  gate for filter row + pagination + column visibility persistence +
  mutation 4-layer + state-machine guards

Both pre-existed with explicit Phase 7.14.3 rationale in docstrings,
but were never registered in registry.yaml or wired into any skill.
Wired into `commands/vg/blueprint.md` step 2d-3b (after the existing
bash grep cross-checks pass). Override flags `--skip-blueprint-completeness`
and `--skip-platform-essentials` log override-debt.

Plus 2 silent-truncation bugs in `scripts/pre-executor-check.py`:

- `extract_contract_section`: matched on LAST PATH SEGMENT only
  → `/api/v1/sites` and `/api/v2/sites` collide → executor for v2 task
  could receive v1 contract. Fix: prefer FULL-PATH match first; fall
  back to last-segment only when full path absent. 3000-char silent
  truncate softened with visible HTML comment.
- `extract_goals_context`: 30-line cap on the LAST goal in
  TEST-GOALS.md → Phase 15 D-16 goals (interactive_controls + persistence
  check + criteria, 50-100+ lines) silently truncated → executor missed
  filter/pagination test plans. Fix: take from start to EOF (R4 budget
  caps prompt size downstream as the right place for that policy).

4 regression tests in `test_phase17_extraction_fixes.py`:
v1/v2 disambiguation (both directions) + last-goal-no-truncation
(persistence check + interactive_controls survive) + non-last-goal still
terminates at next ## Goal heading.

### Test infrastructure

- `scripts/tests/root_verifiers/test_phase17_helpers.py` (18 tests)
- `scripts/tests/root_verifiers/test_phase17_acceptance.py` (42 tests)
- `scripts/tests/root_verifiers/test_phase17_extraction_fixes.py` (4 tests)

Total: 164 passed, 1 skipped (cheerio AST conditional).

### Distribution

`install.sh` Phase 15 wildcard for `_shared/templates/*` auto-catches
the 2 new Playwright templates (no install.sh edit needed). Confirmed
via `bash install.sh /tmp/p17-test`.

## v2.10.0 (2026-04-27) — Phase 15 ship: VG Design Fidelity + UAT Narrative + Filter Test Rigor

Minor release shipping the 4 fixes Phase 7.14.3 RTB exposed in the prior
harness: visual fidelity gates, UAT narrative auto-fire, filter+pagination
test rigor pack, and Haiku-spawn audit (phantom-aware). 28 commits across
10 waves (`08b5fd7..2985a47`), +12k lines, 100 acceptance tests passing.

Every D-XX decision in `dev-phases/15-vg-design-fidelity-v1/DECISIONS.md`
maps to a committed deliverable. Cross-AI reviewed (2 BLOCK + 4 WARN
caught + fixed in commit `2985a47` before this release).

### Visual fidelity gate (D-01, D-02, D-03, D-08, D-12, D-15)

- 4 JSON Schema draft-07 contracts (`schemas/`): `slug-registry.v1.json`,
  `structural-json.v1.json`, `ui-map.v1.json` (5-field-per-node lock),
  `narration-strings.v1.json`.
- Extractor handlers (`scripts/design-normalize.{py,js}`):
  HTML cheerio AST + PNG OCR (`.structural.png` marker) + Pencil MCP
  (`mcp__pencil__*`, encrypted .pen files) + Penboard MCP (`mcp__penboard__*`,
  .penboard/.flow workspaces). 2 distinct MCP servers — separate config blocks.
- 8 validators: `verify-design-{extractor-output,ref-required}.py`,
  `verify-uimap-{schema,injection}.py`, `verify-phase-ui-flag.py`,
  `verify-ui-structure.py` (extended `--scope owner-wave-id=`),
  `verify-holistic-drift.py` (D-12e wrapper).
- Threshold helper (`scripts/lib/threshold-resolver.py`) — D-08 profile
  resolution: prototype 0.70 / default 0.85 / production 0.95.
- UI-MAP wave/task ownership tags (`owner_wave_id`, `owner_task_id`)
  enable subtree filtering via `scripts/extract-subtree-haiku.mjs` (D-14).
  Build step 8c persists composed prompts to
  `.vg/phases/<phase>/.build/wave-<N>/executor-prompts/<task>.md` with
  `## UI-MAP-SUBTREE-FOR-THIS-WAVE` + `## DESIGN-REF` H2 headers so
  `verify-uimap-injection.py` can audit them post-wave.
- Skill body wirings: `scope.md` Check B' (D-02 production-grade BLOCK),
  `blueprint.md` step 2_fidelity_profile_lock + 2b6b D-15 schema check,
  `build.md` step 8c UI-MAP subtree inject + D-12a injection audit,
  `review.md` phase2_5_visual_checks §6 (D-12c UI-flag + D-12b wave drift +
  D-12e holistic drift).

### UAT narrative auto-fire (D-05, D-06, D-07, D-10, D-18)

- Generator: `scripts/build-uat-narrative.py` reads TEST-GOALS frontmatter
  (4 mandatory fields per goal: entry_url, navigation_steps, precondition,
  expected_behavior) and renders `${PHASE_DIR}/UAT-NARRATIVE.md` per
  prompt block.
- Templates: `commands/vg/_shared/templates/uat-narrative-prompt.md.tmpl`
  + `uat-narrative-design-ref-block.md.tmpl` (Mustache-lite placeholders).
- 9 new flat keys in `narration-strings.yaml` (vi+en locales): `uat_entry_label`,
  `uat_role_label`, `uat_account_label`, `uat_navigation_label`,
  `uat_precondition_label`, `uat_expected_label`, `uat_region_label`,
  `uat_screenshot_compare`, `uat_prompt_pfs`.
- Validators: `verify-uat-narrative-fields.py` (4-field check per prompt
  block) + `verify-uat-strings-no-hardcode.py` (D-18 strict — no labels
  outside narration-strings.yaml).
- Wired into `accept.md` step 4b_uat_narrative_autofire (auto-fires
  before step 5 interactive UAT).

### Filter + Pagination Test Rigor Pack (D-16)

- Matrix module: `skills/vg-codegen-interactive/filter-test-matrix.mjs`
  — enumerator + Mustache-lite renderer + helpers:
  `enumerateFilterFiles`, `enumeratePaginationFiles`, `renderTemplate`.
- 10 templates @ `commands/vg/_shared/templates/`:
  `filter-{coverage,stress,state-integrity,edge}.test.tmpl` +
  `pagination-{navigation,url-sync,envelope,display,stress,edge}.test.tmpl`.
- Per-control output: 4 filter spec files + 6 pagination spec files
  containing 13 + 18 source-level `test()` blocks.
- Validator: `verify-filter-test-coverage.py` counts blocks (not files)
  whose name contains the control slug AND the kind keyword
  (filter/pagination); thresholds 13/18.
- Wired into `test.md` step 5d_codegen — deterministic pure-JS path,
  zero Sonnet round-trip, byte-for-byte reproducible.

### Haiku-spawn phantom-aware audit (D-17)

- Validator: `verify-haiku-spawn-fired.py` checks events.db for
  `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` events emitted in `review.md` step 2b-2.
- Phantom signature detection: ignores runs matching `args:""` + 0
  step.marked + abort within 60s — the hook-triggered noise pattern
  diagnosed in `dev-phases/15-vg-design-fidelity-v1/INVESTIGATION-D17.md`.
  Initial Phase 15 hypothesis (53s abort = scanner failure) was wrong;
  v2.8.6 hotfix (411a278) had already fixed the entry-pattern bug 4
  hours after the phantom event — what was missing was *evidence-of-
  firing*, which the new emit + phantom-aware validator now provide.
- Telemetry emit moved to BEFORE Agent() call (commit `4edbaa2`) so
  spawn audit survives even if the Agent crashes mid-spawn.

### Test infrastructure

- `scripts/tests/root_verifiers/test_phase15_design_extractors.py` (3 tests + 1 skip).
- `scripts/tests/root_verifiers/test_phase15_validators_and_matrix.py` (17 tests
  including 7 regression tests added for B1/B2 cross-AI findings).
- `scripts/tests/root_verifiers/test_phase15_acceptance.py` (80 tests across 8
  acceptance dimensions: schemas, validators, scripts, templates, skill
  integrations, config, i18n, regression-green).
- Total: 100 passed, 1 skipped (cheerio AST conditional — runs in consumer).

### Distribution updates (`install.sh`)

- New paths covered: `schemas/*.json`, `scripts/*.mjs`, `scripts/lib/*.py`,
  `commands/vg/_shared/templates/*`, `skills/vg-codegen-interactive/`.

### Deferred to follow-up (cross-AI WARN/INFO list)

W3 path interpolation hardening (Windows backslash escape risk in
`${PYTHON_BIN} -c "...open('${VG_TMP}/...')..."` patterns), W4 events.db
path mismatch (`.vg/events.db` vs `.claude/state/events.db`), I1
WAVE-DRIFT-HISTORY.md aggregator, I2 phantom timing guarded behavior,
I3-I5 informational confirmations.

## v2.9.0 (2026-04-27) — v2.7 Phase A/B/D/E ship + v2.8.6 hotfix bundle

Minor release bundling 4 v2.7 hardening phases (runtime probe, codegen
interactive_controls, orphan triage, artifact JSON schemas) plus the
v2.8.6 hotfix triplet (entry-hook paste-back, argparse prefix-match,
test pollution). Closes the v2.7 hardening epic. Also resolves the
long-stale `VGFLOW-VERSION` file (last bumped at v2.5.2.10) — now
synchronized with `VERSION` going forward.

### v2.7 Phase A — Runtime probe URL state validator

New validator `verify-url-state-runtime.py` reads `${PHASE_DIR}/url-runtime-probe.json`,
validates declared `url_param` in `url_params_after`. WARN on coverage gap,
BLOCK on declaration drift. Wired into `/vg:review` step `phase2_8_url_state_runtime`
(profile-gated: `web-fullstack`, `web-frontend-only`).

### v2.7 Phase B — Codegen interactive_controls skill + output validator

New skill `vg-codegen-interactive` (model: sonnet, user-invocable: false)
generates Playwright `.spec.ts` for `interactive_controls` goals with
deterministic test count formula per filter/sort/pagination declaration.
Reference template `interactive-helpers.template.ts` (~280 LOC) provides
DSL evaluator (`expectAssertion` with 5 grammar forms: `===`, `includes`,
`in`, `monotonic`, `length<=`).

Validator `verify-codegen-output.py` runs 9 checks: AUTO-GENERATED header,
helper imports, no raw `locator()`, deterministic count, no `networkidle`,
no `page.evaluate()` (warn), ROUTE match, DSL grammar conformance, file
naming. Wired into `/vg:test` step `5d_codegen` (BLOCK on violation).

### v2.7 Phase D — Orphan validator triage orchestrator

`_orphans.py` orchestrator with 3 subcommands (`orphans-list`, `orphans-collect`,
`orphans-apply`) for 3-agent partition triage. Canonicalizes IDs across
script-glob, registry, and dispatch sources via `_canonical_id()` (strips
`verify-`/`validate-` prefix). `_resolve_script_path()` tolerates both
naming conventions (`verify-foo.py` and `foo.py`).

Pre-shipped fix: glob changed from `verify-*.py` to `*.py` with non-validator
blocklist (`audit-rule-cards`, `edit-rule-cards`, etc.) — catches bare-stem
files like `acceptance-reconciliation.py` that the old pattern missed.

### v2.7 Phase E — Artifact JSON schemas + write-time validator

7 schemas in `.claude/schemas/{specs,context,plan,test-goals,summary,uat,interactive-controls}.v1.json`
(JSON Schema draft-07, `$id: https://vgflow.dev/schemas/{name}.v1.json`).
Strict frontmatter, lenient body H2 regex.

Single validator `verify-artifact-schema.py` (~340 LOC) handles 6 artifact
types via hand-rolled minimal JSON Schema walker — no external schema lib.
Supports `VG_SCHEMA_GRANDFATHER_BEFORE` env var for legacy phases below
the cutoff. Dual-fire write+read invocation across 6 skill bodies
(specs/scope/blueprint/build/accept).

### v2.8.6 hotfix bundle

Triplet of harness-discipline fixes:
- **Entry-hook paste-back heuristic** — extended `/vg:` literal detection
  to recognize SPEC document content + prose references (4 phantom
  run-starts incidents during v2.7 ship session traced to this gap).
- **argparse prefix-match bug** — `argparse` defaulted to
  `allow_abbrev=True`; `--phase` was silently mapped to `--phase-dir`
  in `verify-runtime-evidence.py`. All validators now use
  `argparse.ArgumentParser(allow_abbrev=False)` defensively.
- **Test pollution** — added `autouse` pytest fixture cleaning
  `VG_REPO_ROOT` env var across tests; eliminates state leak between
  test files that breaks CI ordering.

### `VGFLOW-VERSION` synchronization

The metadata file at `vgflow-repo/VGFLOW-VERSION` (and mirrored
`.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION` in installer projects) was last bumped at
`820b0cd release v2.5.2.10` and skipped in every release pipeline since
v2.6.1 — a 4-tag drift. Reading current `cat .claude/VGFLOW-VERSION`
gave `2.5.2.10` while `VERSION` reported `2.8.5`. Telemetry events
in `install.sh` reported the wrong version.

This release:
- Syncs `VGFLOW-VERSION` ← `VERSION` ← `2.9.0`.
- Going forward, `VGFLOW-VERSION` is bumped lockstep with `VERSION` in
  each release (until/unless we deprecate one of the two files).

### Migration notes

No behavioral changes for existing consumers. Telemetry emitted by
`install.sh` will now report version `2.9.0` instead of `2.5.2.10`
(historical events keep their old version values; only new events affected).

Projects pinning a specific VG version via `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION` should
update the file to `2.9.0` after pulling.

### Decisions deferred to next release

- v2.7 Phase C (skill invariants), Phase F (marker tracking) already shipped
  pre-v2.9.0 (in v2.8.3 + v2.8.5 respectively); no Phase C/F work in this
  release.
- VGFLOW-VERSION deprecation discussion: tracked but not acted on. Both
  files remain present and synchronized.

## v2.8.5 (2026-04-26) — v2.7 Phase F: Marker tracking hooks layer 1+2

Companion to v2.8.3 hybrid Stop-hook (reactive recovery). Layers 1+2
catch marker activity **DURING** work instead of after-the-fact at Stop,
giving observability into step transitions for `/vg:gate-stats` analytics.

### Layer 1 — `vg-entry-hook.py` extension

After successful `run-start`, seed `.vg/.session-context.json`:
```json
{
  "run_id": "...",
  "command": "vg:build",
  "phase": "7.14.3",
  "started_at": "ISO-8601",
  "current_step": null,
  "step_history": [],
  "telemetry_emitted": []
}
```

Best-effort write; never fails `run-start` on session-context error.

### Layer 2 — `vg-step-tracker.py` (NEW PostToolUse Bash hook)

Detects 3 marker write patterns:
- `touch <path>/.step-markers/<step>.{start,done}`
- `mark_step <phase> <step> [<dir>]`
- `vg-orchestrator mark-step <namespace> <step>`

Updates session-context:
- `current_step` ← latest detected step
- `step_history` ← append `{step, transition, ts}` (dedup'd)

Emits `hook.step_active` telemetry per `(run_id, step, transition)`,
dedup'd via `telemetry_emitted` set to avoid event flood.

**Always exits 0** — never blocks bash execution. No-op when:
- Tool is not Bash
- No active `/vg:*` run (no session-context.json)
- Bash command doesn't match marker patterns

### Settings.local.json registration

```jsonc
"PostToolUse": [
  { "matcher": "Edit|Write|...", "hooks": [...] },   // existing
  { "matcher": "Bash",
    "hooks": [{ "command": "python ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scripts/vg-step-tracker.py" }]
  }
]
```

### Why this matters

v2.8.3 hybrid Stop-hook auto-recovers from marker drift but only **after** the run ends. Phase F lets us:
- See step transitions live in `.vg/.session-context.json`
- Query `hook.step_active` events via `/vg:gate-stats` to find skills with
  high drift (steps the AI consistently misses)
- Future v2.9 — proactive Stop hook can use step_history to detect drift
  earlier and route to migrate-state proactively

### Tests

- `test_step_tracker_hook.py` — 12 cases (pattern detection + state updates +
  dedup behavior)
- Regression: 42/42 pass (url-state, hybrid, migrate-state, contract-pins, codex-mirror)
- **Total: 54/54 pass**


## v2.8.4 (2026-04-26) — Phase J: Interactive Controls (URL state + pagination UI)

Closes blind spot in `/vg:review` and `/vg:test` for list/table/grid views.
6-layer enforcement stack ensures AI executors ship dashboard list views
with proper URL state sync + correct pagination UI pattern.

### Layers

1. **TEST-GOAL schema** — `interactive_controls` block (filters / pagination /
   search / sort + `url_sync` flag) with assertion fields per control.
2. **FOUNDATION §9.9 + `vg.config.md` `ui_state_conventions`** — locks
   project convention (kebab/csv/300ms/page-size 20 + pagination UI pattern).
3. **Executor R7** — MANDATORY at `/vg:build`: list view state MUST sync URL
   via framework router (Next `useSearchParams`, React Router, etc.).
   Pagination UI MUST be `<<  <  N±5  >  >>` + "Showing X-Y of Z" + "Page N of M".
   Plain prev-next-only is BANNED.
4. **Blueprint generator (step 2b5 rule 7)** — auto-populates
   `interactive_controls` for list view goals based on main_steps signals.
5. **Static validator `verify-url-state-sync.py`** — BLOCKs missing block;
   rejects banned `ui_pattern` values; severity follows phase cutover.
6. **Review gate (phase 2.7)** — invokes validator with `--allow-no-url-sync`
   override path → soft OD debt.

### Migration

| Phase | Mode |
|-------|------|
| Phase < 14 (legacy) | WARN (grandfather) |
| Phase ≥ 14 (cutover) | HARD BLOCK (mandatory) |
| Override per-goal | `interactive_controls.url_sync: false` + `url_sync_waive_reason` |
| Override per-phase | CLI flag `--allow-no-url-sync` → soft OD debt |

`severity_phase_cutover` configurable in `vg.config.md` (default 14).

### Pagination UI rule (locked)

```
[<<]  [<]  [N-5] [N-4] [N-3] [N-2] [N-1] [N] [N+1] [N+2] [N+3] [N+4] [N+5]  [>]  [>>]

Showing 21–40 of 1,247 records          Page 2 of 63
```

Defaults (`vg.config.md` `ui_state_conventions.pagination_ui`):
- `pattern: "first-prev-numbered-window-next-last"` (locked)
- `window_radius: 5`
- `show_total_records: true`, `show_total_pages: true`
- `truncate_with_ellipsis: true`

Override only with explicit infinite-scroll declaration in FOUNDATION §9.9.

### Tests

- `test_url_state_sync_validator.py` — 12 cases
- Regression: 30/30 (hybrid hook, migrate-state, contract-pins, codex-mirror)
- Codex mirror equivalence: 44/44 functionally equivalent

---

## v2.8.3 (2026-04-26) — Hybrid Stop-hook marker-drift auto-recovery

Tier C complement to Tier A (`/vg:migrate-state`) and Tier B (contract pins).
When `run-complete` BLOCKs purely on `must_touch_markers` (no `must_write`,
no `must_emit_telemetry` violations), drift is tracked per-`run_id` in
`.vg/.session-drift.json`:

  - 1st drift in session → BLOCK with hint, increment counter
  - 2nd+ drift → auto-fire `migrate-state {phase} --apply`, retry
    `run-complete`; on PASS approve + emit `hook.marker_drift_recovered`
    telemetry event

### Anti-forge contract

`AUTO_FIRE_ELIGIBLE_TYPES` is hard-coded to `{must_touch_markers}`.
Mixed violations always BLOCK because telemetry/file gaps signal real
pipeline issues, not paperwork drift. `must_write` (artifacts) and
`must_emit_telemetry` (events) cannot be backfilled without proof.

### Why hybrid instead of always-block / always-auto-fire

- **Always-block**: forces session restart for skill-cache, infinite loop pain.
- **Always-auto-fire**: AI learns marker discipline doesn't matter, kỷ luật loãng.
- **Hybrid**: 1st miss = lesson, 2nd+ = recover (no value in repeating same hint).

### Drift state schema

`.vg/.session-drift.json`:
```json
{
  "<run_id>": {
    "drift_count": 1,
    "first_drift_at": "ISO",
    "last_drift_at": "ISO",
    "violations_seen": ["must_touch_markers"]
  }
}
```

GC'd after 120 minutes of inactivity per run_id.

### Tests

- `test_verify_claim_hybrid.py` — 9 cases
- Regression: 21/21 (migrate-state, contract-pins, codex-mirror)


## v2.8.2 (2026-04-26) — Skill-version drift permanently solved

### Tier A — `/vg:migrate-state` (commit 6324c2fd in source)
New command for retroactive marker drift repair. Idempotent scan + apply
based on artifact evidence. Logs single override-debt entry per applied
phase (no register bloat). Multi-plan phases (07.13-style with 07.13-NN-PLAN.md
naming) handled via glob evidence patterns.

Modes: `--scan`, `{phase}` shorthand, `--apply-all`, `--dry-run`, `--json`.

### Tier B — Per-phase contract pinning (commit 227ea852 in source)
`.vg/phases/{phase}/.contract-pins.json` written at `/vg:scope`,
snapshotting `must_touch_markers` + `must_emit_telemetry` for all 6
tracked commands. Subsequent runs validate against the pinned contract,
not the live skill body. Harness upgrades that mutate marker contracts
no longer retroactively invalidate already-shipped phases.

`/vg:migrate-state --apply` writes pins for legacy phases at current
harness version (best-effort retroactive lock).

### Bug fix — orchestrator tolerates non-JSON validator stdout (commit 9515cd86)
11 validators that emit human-friendly text by default (e.g. "✓ All good",
"⛔ Drift") were crashing the validator dispatcher with
`Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)`. Orchestrator now synthesizes
verdict from exit code when stdout has no `{`: 0 → PASS, 1 → WARN, 2+ → SKIP.
Validators still preferred to emit JSON when invoked with `--json`.

### Audit fixups — N9 + N10 (commit a44503c0)
- N9: `/vg:blueprint` commit step now tracks every blueprint output
  (TEST-GOALS.md unconditionally + UI-SPEC/UI-MAP/UI-MAP-AS-IS/FLOW-SPEC
  via existence guards). Prevents silent orphan files.
- N10: `/vg:sync --verify` mode hashes post-`</codex_skill_adapter>` mirror
  content vs post-frontmatter source content. Catches functional drift
  invisible in the line-level `sync.sh --check` diff.

### Verification
55/55 regression tests pass (idempotency, no-no-verify, orchestrator
dispatch, mirror equivalence, validator non-JSON tolerance, migrate-state,
contract pins).

## v2.8.1 (2026-04-26) — Hotfix

Audit-driven fixups against `/vg:build` vs `/vg:blueprint` artifact flow.

### Critical fixes
- **C1** — `build.md` 3c_amendment_freshness sub-step: builder re-reads `AMENDMENT-LOG.md` mid-build and rebinds contract/goal/context-refs (prevents stale-state drift after `/vg:amend`).
- **C2** — Pinned architectural invariant via smoke test `test_orchestrator_dispatches_blueprint_validators.py` — orchestrator dispatches blueprint validators by COMMAND key (not step), preventing future refactor regression.

### Major fixes
- **M3** — Contract dedup: build skips contract injection if symbol already exists in target schemas file (prevents duplicate identifier collisions).
- **M4** — CONTEXT.md mtime gate: build aborts if CONTEXT.md modified after blueprint completion stamp (forces re-blueprint).
- **M5** — Removed stale `RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md` reference from `R5_FILES` list (artifact deprecated in v2.6).
- **M6** — Build reads pre-build CrossAI verdict from `crossai/blueprint-review.xml` and surfaces BLOCK findings before wave dispatch.
- **M7** — Documented blueprint vs Gate U utility check intent (clarifies overlap is intentional defense-in-depth, not redundancy).
- **M8** — Removed dead `--skip-design-check` flag from blueprint command-line list (kept doc-comment refs at lines 67, 72).

### Audit transparency
This release includes the full audit cycle commits (revert + surgical re-do for M5+M8) so operators can trace the regression detection that prevented the original M5+M8 commit from over-deleting 79 lines including `Platform Essentials` and `Blueprint Completeness` UNQUARANTINABLE gate blocks.

### Verification
- 29/29 tests pass (`test_idempotency_coverage.py`, `test_no_no_verify.py`, `test_orchestrator_dispatches_blueprint_validators.py`)
- Pre-commit RULES-CARDS drift gate enforced
- `Platform Essentials` invariant grep = 3 hits intact in source `.codex/skills/vg-blueprint/RULES-CARDS.md`

## [2.8.0] - 2026-04-26

VG workflow-hardening v2.7 plan — 8 phases shipped covering forward-gap closure from v2.7.0 ship + audit dim-3/4/6/7 HIGH+MEDIUM closure.

### Added
- **Phase J** (OS-keychain integration) — `verify_human_operator()` HMAC token now stored in OS keychain (Keychain Access macOS, Credential Manager Windows, Secret Service Linux). Migration script + per-OS onboarding doc. File fallback retained for headless CI.
- **Phase K** (Hardcode refactor) — 34→5 occurrences (-85%). HARDCODE-REGISTER.md + drift gate. `verify-no-hardcoded-paths.py` extended with line-level INTENTIONAL_HARDCODE annotation support.
- **Phase M** (Hotfix override extension) — 5 new gate_ids auto-resolve via `override_auto_resolve_clean_run`: allow-orthogonal-hotfix, allow-no-bugref, allow-empty-hotfix, allow-empty-bugfix, allow-unresolved-overrides. Resolution events emitted from /vg:review phase1_code_scan.
- **Phase N** (Manual rule-card breadth) — 110 entries across 12 mid-traffic skills (vg-blueprint, vg-scope, vg-specs, vg-amend, vg-design-extract, vg-design-system, vg-init, vg-project, vg-roadmap, vg-prioritize, vg-haiku-scanner, vg-reflector). 26.5% validator-linked. AUDIT.md dim-4 closure: 13.3% → 35.6%.
- **Phase O** (Root-verifier test breadth) — 12 verifier tests + bootstrap-loader meta-test. AUDIT.md dim-7 closure: validator coverage in `.claude/scripts/validators/` from 80% → **100%** (51/51).
- **Phase P** (Skill invariants + manual-card schema validator) — single UNQUARANTINABLE validator covers SKILL.md structural invariants (step numbering, frontmatter, marker presence, sync gate) + RULES-CARDS-MANUAL.md schema (body length, tag enum, validator-link existence, anti-pattern incident reference). Phase L (skill invariant contracts) merged into P.
- **Phase Q-decay sub-deliverable** (Calibration decay policy) — `registry-calibrate.py --apply-decay` flag with TTY/HMAC + audit emit. Suggestions older than configurable threshold without confirming evidence auto-retire RETIRED-in-place. Phase Q full re-eval calendar-gated, deferred to v2.9.
- **Phase R** (Cross-platform CI parity + pre-commit drift hook) — CI matrix on ubuntu-latest + macos-latest + windows-latest. UTF-8 subprocess helper. `.githooks/pre-commit` blocks RULES-CARDS drift when SKILL.md changes without re-running `extract-rule-cards.py`. 28 documented test failures closed (21 Linux + 7 Windows-encoding).

### Changed
- `.claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator/__main__.py` — UNQUARANTINABLE allowlist grew 34 → 35 (verify-skill-invariants added)
- `.claude/scripts/registry-calibrate.py` — `apply-decay` action added with TTY/HMAC + min-50-char reason gate (matches override-resolve and calibrate apply patterns from v2.7.0)
- `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/override-debt.sh` — `auto_resolve_clean_run` gate_id table extended with 5 new entries
- `.claude/scripts/validators/audit-rule-cards.py` — `--check-schema` flag delegates to verify-skill-invariants for schema portion (avoid duplicate parsers)
- `.claude/vg.config.md` — added 3 new sections: `security_keychain.*`, `validators_skill_invariants.*`, `calibration.decay_after_phases`. Commit-msg pattern widened to accept `feat(harness-vN.M-XX):` style.

### Tests
- ~1240 cumulative tests passing (38 v2.7 phase tests + 19 v2.6.1 security regression + 1183 carried-forward).

### Migration
Backward compatible. Existing `.approver-key` files continue working via fallback. Existing 783 auto-extracted rules unchanged. Existing config keys unchanged. Operator runs migration scripts opt-in.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-26

VG workflow-hardening v2.6 plan — 8 phases shipped in atomic commits with goal-backward verification.
Cumulative: 180 tests passing on source repo (45 v2.6 phase tests + 19 v2.6.1 security regression + 112 root-verifier backfill + 4 learn TTY).

### Added
- **Phase A** (Bootstrap shadow evaluator + critic merged) — adaptive rule promotion replacing fixed `tier_a_auto_promote_after_confirms=3`. Reads `.vg/events.jsonl`, computes correctness rate per candidate via commit-msg citation parser. Optional `--critic` flag emits Haiku LLM advisory verdict per Tier-B candidate.
- **Phase C** (Conflict auto-retire) — pairwise Jaccard + opposing-verb conflict detection, reuses `learn-dedupe.py` similarity. New `RETIRED_BY_CONFLICT` candidate status, `conflict_winner` field. Surfaces in same accept.md step 6c y/n/e/s loop.
- **Phase D** (Phase-scoped rules) — `phase_pattern` regex field per rule. `inject-rule-cards.sh --current-phase X.Y` filters rules whose pattern doesn't match. New `verify-rule-phase-scope.py` validator.
- **Phase E** (Dogfood metrics dashboard) — single-file HTML aggregator. 5 panels: autonomy %, override rate, friction time per skill, shadow correctness, conflict + quarantine snapshot. Reuses existing `vg-orchestrator quarantine status --json` and `query-events`. Stdlib-only.
- **Phase F** (Auto-severity calibration) — `registry-calibrate.py` + `vg-orchestrator calibrate` subcommand. Computes severity downgrade/upgrade suggestions (BLOCK→WARN if override > 60%, WARN→BLOCK if downstream-correlation > 80%). UNQUARANTINABLE list (34 entries) hard-exempt from downgrade. TTY/HMAC + min-50-char reason gate on apply.
- **Phase G** (`/vg:learn` TTY/HMAC parity) — promote/reject mutating ops now require TTY OR HMAC-signed token. Audit events on success + on blocked-attempt forensic trail. Closes parity gap with `--override-reason` and `cmd_calibrate apply`.
- **Phase H** (Manual rule-card adoption) — 50 operator-curated `RULES-CARDS-MANUAL.md` entries across 4 high-traffic skills (vg-build, vg-review, vg-test, vg-accept). 14 validator-linked. Closes AUDIT.md dim-4 finding 4 (manual adoption: 4.5% → 13.3%).
- **Phase I** (Root-verifier test backfill) — 112 unit tests across 13 root verifiers (10 UNQUARANTINABLE, 3 BLOCK-severity high-LOC) + bootstrap-test-runner meta-test. Closes AUDIT.md dim-7 HIGH gap.

### Changed
- `learn-tier-classify.py` accepts `--shadow-jsonl` for adaptive threshold (grandfathers v2.5 behavior when absent)
- `vg-reflector/SKILL.md` candidate emit adds `shadow_mode: true` + `confirmed_by_telemetry` + `phase_pattern` suggestion
- `accept.md` step 6c surface accommodates 3 sources: shadow-evaluator promotions (A), conflict pairs (C), phase_pattern proposals (D)
- `.claude/vg.config.md` + 4 new key groups: `bootstrap.shadow.*`, `bootstrap.critic.*`, `telemetry.dashboard_lookback_phases`, `calibration.*`

### Migration
Backward compatible. Existing 783 rules without `phase_pattern` continue injecting unchanged. Existing event types preserved. Operator runs `python3 .claude/scripts/validators/extract-rule-cards.py` separately if RULES-CARDS regen wanted.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-04-26

### 7-dimension audit + 7-batch fix release — closes 13 CRITICAL + most HIGH findings

Comprehensive harness audit (`.vg/harness-audit-2026-04-26/`) ran 7 parallel
Explore agents covering: validator wiring, override/bypass surfaces,
migration debt, memory mechanism, step sync, config drift, self-test
coverage. **125 findings** total: 13 CRITICAL, 43 HIGH, 37 MEDIUM, 32 LOW.

Three most surprising discoveries:
1. `inject_rule_cards` helper was 0/44 invoked — 783 extracted rules were
   dead code, AI never read them at runtime
2. 22 bypass flags (`--override-reason`, `--allow-*`, `--skip-*`), zero
   had TTY/HMAC caller authentication — AI subagent could self-inject
3. CI never ran harness Python tests — regressions in `.claude/scripts/*`
   merged silently for months

### Batch A — UNQUARANTINABLE protect 5 security validators (commit d541dc86)

Wires 5 wired-but-unprotected validators into UNQUARANTINABLE allowlist:
verify-authz-declared, verify-auth-flow-smoke, verify-oauth-pkce-enforcement,
verify-rollback-procedure, verify-2fa-gate (severity bumped WARN→BLOCK).

### Batch B — Activate rule card injection (commit 9415a755)

Wires `inject_rule_cards` at first step of 7 high-traffic skills (vg-scope,
specs, blueprint, build, review, test, accept). 783 rules + 331 anti-
patterns now actually emitted to AI context at step start. Adds
`verify-rule-cards-fresh` drift gate to `/vg:accept` step 1.

### Batch C — Override caller-auth + quarantine recovery (commit a009dc2d)

Closes the AI self-injection class of bugs:
- `--override-reason` now requires TTY OR signed HMAC approver token
  (`verify_human_operator()` reused from v2.5.2.1 `--allow-*` path)
- Rubber-stamp escalator: same reason fingerprint copy-pasted across ≥2
  prior phases → BLOCK
- Stale-quarantine cleanup: validators promoted to UNQUARANTINABLE AFTER
  being disabled never got a chance to recover. New helper +
  `vg-orchestrator quarantine status / re-enable / force-enable-stale`
  CLI subcommands.

### Batch D — CI pytest gate + 19 critical security tests (commit 7dd9d650)

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` adds harness-tests job:
- Full suite warn-only (21 pre-existing Linux/Windows failures need v2.6.2)
- Hard gate for `test_idempotency_coverage.py` (9 tests) +
  `test_no_no_verify.py` (10 tests) — anti retry-storm/double-charge +
  pre-commit hook bypass

### Batch E — Schema drift canonicalization (commit 2524614d)

6 validators canonicalize FAIL/OK/SKIP → BLOCK/PASS/SKIP at output point.
Plus REAL bug: `verify-artifact-freshness` and `verify-command-contract-
coverage` emitted JSON without top-level verdict field → orchestrator
shim defaulted to PASS regardless of internal failures. Now emit
"verdict": BLOCK when failures.

### Batch F — UNQUARANTINABLE protect 11 more validators (commit fef97811)

Closer inspection of D1 audit's 30 "orphan" validators: 29/30 were
actually wired in COMMAND_VALIDATORS dict (audit grepped only `.md` files).
1 genuine orphan (verify-design-gap-hunter — that's a SKILL not a validator).

Of the 29 wired BLOCK validators, 11 security/integrity-critical were
missing UNQUARANTINABLE protection. Added: container-hardening,
cookie-flags-runtime, dast-waive-approver, dependency-vuln-budget,
no-hardcoded-paths, no-no-verify, security-baseline-project, security-
headers-runtime, allow-flag-audit, vps-deploy-evidence, clean-failure-state.

### Batch G — Hotfix override resolution event correlation (commit 449ccdb7)

Fixes 3 review.md `log_override_debt` calls that had positional args
mis-ordered (flag-as-name, phase-dir-as-reason, gate_id always missing).
New gate_id taxonomy: review-goal-coverage, bugfix-bugref-required,
bugfix-code-delta-required.

New `override_auto_resolve_clean_run` helper + wired into `/vg:review`
step "complete". When current phase review runs clean, prior phases'
matching debt entries auto-resolve. Closes the "hotfix debt piles up
forever" pattern.

### Net state v2.6.1

- UNQUARANTINABLE: 18 → 34 entries (manifest)
- Memory mechanism: dead → live (783 rules + 331 anti-patterns active)
- CI: 3 jobs (build-ts, build-rust, audit) → 4 jobs (+ harness-tests)
- Override surface: 22 flags w/o auth → all gated by TTY/HMAC + min-50
  char + placeholder + rubber-stamp escalator

### Deferred to v2.7 (genuine reasons)

- 52 untested scripts (volume — ~26h work)
- 21 pre-existing Linux CI failures (need Linux env to validate fixes)
- 22 hardcoded SSH/path/port instances (touches deployment, needs phase)

## [2.5.2.1] - 2026-04-24

### Hotfix — close 3 major findings from v2.5.2 CrossAI round-3

CrossAI round-3 consensus on v2.5.2 (Codex 7.9/10 FLAG, Claude 8.0/10 FLAG,
Gemini 9.2/10 PASS; consensus FLAG ship_with_changes). 3 MAJOR findings
consensus-flagged by Codex + Claude are closed in this patch.

### Fix 1 — HMAC-signed allow-flag tokens (closes Codex+Claude major)

**Problem:** v2.5.2 `VG_HUMAN_OPERATOR` env was a raw handle string.
AI subprocess could `os.environ["VG_HUMAN_OPERATOR"] = "real-human"`
before exec and bypass Phase O's allow-flag gate — same "narrated vs
behavioral" forge surface v2.5.2 was meant to close, just shifted from
validators to the gate itself.

**Fix:**
- `allow_flag_gate.py` now supports HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens. Token format:
  `b64url(payload_json).b64url(sig)` where payload = `{handle, flag,
  issued_at, expires_at}`. Signing key at `~/.vg/.approver-key` (0600 POSIX,
  user-profile protected Windows). Wildcard flag `*` permitted for short-
  lived session tokens.
- Strict mode (via `allow_flags.strict_mode=true` config OR
  `VG_ALLOW_FLAGS_STRICT_MODE=true` env) rejects raw-string env entirely.
  Non-strict mode accepts raw string with `[unsigned-warning]` suffix in
  approver (audit visibility).
- New CLI `.claude/scripts/vg-auth.py`:
  - `approve --flag X --ttl-days N` — TTY-only; mints token
  - `verify --token T --flag X` — explicit verification (debugging)
  - `init` — force-create signing key (idempotent)
- Negative test: AI subprocess with different key dir → signature
  invalid → blocked.

**Residual risk:** same-user AI can read `~/.vg/.approver-key` file
directly (file permissions don't isolate same-user processes). Mitigation:
`strict_mode=true` + TTY-only approval at time of use.

### Fix 2 — Full registry catalog + drift coverage (closes Codex+Claude major)

**Problem:** Phase S shipped 24-entry registry covering v2.5.2 validators
only. ~36 legacy pre-v2.5.2 validators stayed uncataloged. `verify-
validator-drift` was blind to them — defeated the "close opacity gap"
problem statement.

**Fix:**
- New `.claude/scripts/backfill-registry.py`: auto-discovers all
  `validators/*.py`, parses docstring first line for description,
  appends entries with placeholder metadata (`severity: warn`,
  `domain: uncategorized`, `phases_active: [all]`,
  `added_in: pre-v2.5.2`) for reviewer to tighten.
- `registry.yaml` now has **60 entries** (was 24). Backfilled legacy
  validators: acceptance-reconciliation, accessibility-scan, build-crossai-
  required, build-telemetry-surface, check-override-events, commit-
  attribution, context-structure, dast-scan-report, deferred-evidence,
  deps-security-scan, event-reconciliation, goal-coverage, i18n-coverage,
  mutation-layers, not-scanned-replay, override-debt-balance, runtime-
  evidence, skill-runtime-contract, and 18+ more.
- `verify-validator-drift.py` extended with
  `_detect_registry_coverage()` that fires `missing_from_registry`
  finding for any `*.py` file in validators/ without registry entry —
  ops sees catalog gaps first before behavioral drift checks.

### Fix 3 — `bootstrap-legacy-artifacts.py` shipped (closes Codex+Claude major)

**Problem:** Phase K `verify-artifact-freshness` requires manifest entries
with `creator_run_id == current_run_id`. Grandfathered phases 0-16 had
no manifest → Phase 17+ cutover forced projects into
`--allow-legacy-manifest-accept` flag whose env-approver path was the
Fix 1 forge surface. Two weak gates compounded.

**Fix:**
- New `.claude/scripts/bootstrap-legacy-artifacts.py`: walks
  `.vg/phases/*/`, discovers must_write artifacts (PLAN.md, API-CONTRACTS.md,
  SPECS.md, CONTEXT.md, SUMMARY*.md, RUNTIME-MAP.json, GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md,
  SANDBOX-TEST.md, UAT.md, FOUNDATION.md, ROADMAP.md, crossai/*.xml),
  writes entries with `creator_run_id: "legacy-bootstrap"`,
  `grandfathered: true`, `phase: <phase-name>`. `--dry-run` default;
  `--apply` commits; `--phase FILTER` for single-phase mode.
- New `verify-no-legacy-manifest-creation.py`: scans the legacy-bootstrap
  manifest for entries with `phase > cutover_phase` (default 17) → BLOCK
  (AI forging grandfather marker past cutover). Also scans all other run
  manifests for `creator_run_id: "legacy-bootstrap"` OR `grandfathered:
  true` → BLOCK (only bootstrap tool may emit those).

### Test results

- Fix 1: 19 new test cases (sign/verify, strict mode, AI forge attempts) + existing Phase O suite 12/12 green
- Fix 2: 7 new test cases (backfill + drift) + existing Phase S 12/12 green
- Fix 3: 10 new test cases (bootstrap + cutover enforcement)
- **36 new tests, all pass + no existing regression.**

### Schema / config additions

- Config key `allow_flags.strict_mode: bool` (Fix 1)
- Env vars: `VG_APPROVER_KEY_DIR` (test override),
  `VG_ALLOW_FLAGS_STRICT_MODE` (runtime override)
- Manifest fields: `grandfathered: true`, `phase: <phase-name>` (Fix 3)

## [2.5.2] - 2026-04-24

### Deep harness hardening — 8 phases (0, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, R, S)

Post-v2.5.1 CrossAI round (Codex 7.2/10, Claude 7.2/10, both FLAG with
`ship_with_changes`) surfaced 13 findings across consensus + individual
reviewer flags. v2.5.2 ships hardening for each.

### New contract schema fields (runtime-contract.json)

- `mutates_repo`: bool — mutating commands must declare
- `observation_only`: bool — read-only commands exempt from evidence checks
- `contract_exempt_reason`: str — required when observation_only=true
- `must_be_created_in_run`: bool — artifact's manifest entry must have
  `creator_run_id == current run_id` (Phase K stale-artifact gate)
- `check_provenance`: bool — also verify `source_inputs` haven't drifted
- `validate_crossai_xml`: bool — invoke XML validator on crossai outputs
- `must_have_consensus: N` — N CLI results must agree on verdict
- `security_runtime`: object — runtime security validator dispatch
- `mutation_journal`: object — require rollback-able mutation logging

### Phase 0 — Codex mirror sync preflight (continuous, not release-gate-only)

- `verify-codex-skill-mirror-sync.py` — SHA256 parity across
  `.claude/commands/vg/` ↔ `.codex/skills/` ↔ `~/.codex/skills/` ↔
  `vgflow-repo/` with CRLF/LF normalization for Windows
- `sync-vg-skills.py` — orchestrated sync + version bump + commit+tag
- `premutation-sync-check.sh` — 24h-cached pre-command hook
- Orchestrator preflight wired in `cmd_run_start`

### Phase J — Command contract coverage (34 commands backfilled)

- `verify-command-contract-coverage.py` — catches skills missing
  runtime_contract on mutating commands
- 26 mutating commands: `mutates_repo: true` + `must_emit_telemetry`
- 8 observation-only: `observation_only: true` + `contract_exempt_reason`

### Phase K — Artifact-run binding + provenance chain

- `emit-evidence-manifest.py` — writes sha256 + creator_run_id per
  artifact to `.vg/runs/{run_id}/evidence-manifest.json`
- `verify-artifact-freshness.py` — blocks stale artifacts from prior
  runs satisfying must_write (prevents Codex-identified forge surface)

### Phase L — Trust-anchor XML validation + CrossAI multi-CLI consensus

- `validate-crossai-review-xml.py` — XPath checks: verdict in
  {pass,flag,block}, score 0-10, reviewer non-empty, handles preamble
- `verify-crossai-multi-cli.py` — N CLIs agreeing + reviewer diversity
  (blocks single-reviewer spoofing)

### Phase M — Security runtime enforcement (10 validators)

**Infrastructure (6):** `verify-security-baseline-project.py` (orchestrator),
`verify-cookie-flags-runtime.py`, `verify-security-headers-runtime.py`
(HSTS/CSP/X-Frame/nosniff), `verify-authz-negative-paths.py`
(cross-tenant IDOR probes), `verify-dependency-vuln-budget.py`
(CVE budget per severity), `verify-container-hardening.py`
(non-root + HEALTHCHECK + pinned tag).

**Application auth (4):** `verify-jwt-session-policy.py` (RS256/ES256,
≤15min access, ≤7d refresh, revocation path), `verify-oauth-pkce-enforcement.py`
(PKCE S256 + state + nonce), `verify-2fa-gate.py` (TOTP/WebAuthn),
`verify-log-hygiene.py` (SAST + runtime log scan for leaked
Authorization/password/token/secret/email).

### Phase N — DAST waive approver gate

- `verify-dast-waive-approver.py` — each waived finding MUST have:
  approver in allowlist, non-expired `waive_until`, 100+ char reason,
  rubber-stamp detection (same approver+reason ≥3× → flag),
  ratio gate (waived/total > 0.3 → warn)

### Phase O — Orchestrator lock + journal + allow-flag human-only gate

- `vg-orchestrator/lock.py` — repo-level advisory lock with stale-break
  on dead pid OR ttl elapsed
- `vg-orchestrator/journal.py` — append-only JSONL mutation journal +
  `rollback_run()` for file_write/file_delete/config_change actions
- `vg-orchestrator/allow_flag_gate.py` — TTY check + `VG_HUMAN_OPERATOR`
  env override + rubber-stamp detection
- 3 new validators: `verify-clean-failure-state.py`,
  `verify-override-debt-sla.py`, `verify-allow-flag-audit.py`
- `__main__.py` acquires lock in `cmd_run_start`, blocks `--allow-*`
  flags for non-TTY/non-env-approver sessions

### Phase P — Behavioral bootstrap verify

- `vg-orchestrator/prompt_capture.py` — captures actual executor
  prompts to `.vg/runs/{run_id}/executor-prompts/task-{N}.prompt.txt`
  with sha256 manifest (AI cannot forge — capture is in orchestrator
  path before subagent spawn)
- `verify-bootstrap-carryforward.py` — greps active LEARN-RULES.md
  rule text in captured prompts (behavioral — not event log)
- `verify-learn-promotion.py` — Tier-A promotions must appear in
  first subsequent-run prompts

### Phase R — Prose-to-PY behavioral validators

- `verify-executor-context-scope.py` — D-XX IDs in prompt MUST match
  declared `<context-refs>` (blocks full-mode silent fallback)
- `verify-review-loop-evidence.py` — consecutive review iterations
  MUST show git file delta OR explicit `resolution: "no_fix_needed"`
- `evaluate-test-requirements.py` — automated critical/important
  goals must have test with ≥2 assertions + E2E if user-flow goal

### Phase S — Validator registry + drift detection

- `validators/registry.yaml` — catalog of 24 v2.5.2 validators
- `validator-registry.py` — CLI: list/describe/missing/orphans/
  validate/disable/enable
- `verify-validator-drift.py` — detect never_fires / always_pass /
  high_block_rate / perf_regression patterns over events.db
- `/vg:validators` slash command (observation_only contract)

### Test results

- 214/214 v2.5.2 phase tests pass (8 test files, 29.7s)
- Batch M1: 45/45 infra tests pass
- Batch M2: 24/24 app-auth tests pass
- Batch O: 45/45 orchestrator tests pass
- Batch P+R+S: 14+26+12 = 52/52 behavioral tests pass
- Batch N: 12/12 waive approver tests pass

### Migration strategy

- Grandfather phases 0-16, cutover phase 17+ hard enforce
- Cold-start manifest bootstrap for grandfathered artifacts
- `--allow-*` flags require TTY OR `VG_HUMAN_OPERATOR` env (human-only)
- Rubber-stamp detection after 3× same-approver-same-flag usage

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-24

### Anti-Forge Hardening — evidence-backed contracts

v2.5.1 closes the forge surface where `/vg:blueprint 7.14` reported PASS but
CrossAI never actually ran (only the marker file was touched — empty
`crossai/` dir, 0 `crossai.*` events). Marker alone is forgeable; evidence
must bind to (artifact presence) + (telemetry event) pairs with optional
flag waiver.

### Schema extensions (runtime-contract.json)

- `glob_min_count: N` — path treated as glob, require ≥N matches
- `required_unless_flag: "--flag"` — waiver mechanism; logs
  `contract.artifact_waived` / `contract.telemetry_waived` INFO events

### Task-list visibility gate

Every pipeline command entry step now invokes `emit-tasklist.py` helper
(authoritative step list from `filter-steps.py`) + emits `{cmd}.tasklist_shown`
event so AI cannot start a flow silently without showing the user the plan.

Wired into: `specs`, `scope`, `blueprint`, `build`, `review`, `test`, `accept`.

### Prose cleanup — gsd-executor tag removal

3 skill files had lingering `gsd-executor` prose references that caused
orchestrator to spawn wrong agent type despite explicit `subagent_type=
"general-purpose"` declaration:
- `build.md:503` — resume-safe note
- `design-extract.md:36` — available_agent_types block
- `_shared/vg-executor-rules.md:4` — header comment

Cleaned → VG-native "no external workflow dependency" language.

### New files

- `.claude/scripts/emit-tasklist.py` — tasklist visibility helper
- `.claude/scripts/tests/test_contract_antiforge.py` — 13 cases
- `.claude/scripts/tests/test_tasklist_visibility.py` — 28 cases

### Enforcement proof

- Forge attempt WITHOUT `--skip-crossai` + no real crossai/*.xml → Stop hook
  BLOCK with `[must_write] crossai/result-*.xml (glob matches 0 < required 1)`
  + `[must_emit_telemetry] crossai.verdict (expected ≥1, got 0)`
- Waiver path WITH `--skip-crossai` + override 50+ chars + commit SHA →
  PASS, emits `contract.*_waived` INFO events + OD-XXXX debt entry

### Codex skill mirror sync restored

`.codex/skills/` and `~/.codex/skills/` had drifted pre-v2.5.0. Full sync
restored parity across 4 locations (RTB source, vgflow-repo, .codex local,
~/.codex global). All 41 skills hash-match.

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-23

### Workflow Hardening — 8 phases closing B+ → Best-in-class workflow discipline

v2.5 implements the approved 8-phase hardening plan. Goal: move VG from a
B+ harness into **best-in-class workflow discipline for structured-domain
Claude Code projects** — verifiable autonomy with auditable gate enforcement,
cross-phase artifact integrity, and model-portable executor contracts.

### Phase A — Post-wave independent verification

Post-wave-complete subprocess re-runs typecheck + affected tests + contract
verify OUTSIDE commit mutex. Divergence → soft reset + escalate. Wave-level
(not per-task) to avoid 5× mutex pressure. `--allow-verify-divergence`
override logs to debt register.

### Phase B — Security 3-tier + Perf Budget + DAST

**Tier 1 static (per-endpoint, inline TEST-GOALS frontmatter):** full OWASP
Top 10 2021 coverage + ASVS Level 2 per goal; mutation endpoints require
CSRF + rate_limit; auth_model cross-check against API-CONTRACTS.

**Tier 2 dynamic (DAST at /vg:test step 5h):** ZAP/Nuclei cascade spawns
active scan against deployed sandbox. Risk-profile-aware severity gate:
`critical` = High finding BLOCKs, `low` = all advisory. `--skip-dast` +
`--allow-dast-findings` overrides log to debt.

**Tier 3 project-wide baseline (`verify-security-baseline.py`):** grep
codebase + deploy scripts for TLS version / HSTS header / wildcard CORS +
credentials / real secrets in .env.example / cookie flags / lockfile
integrity. Fires at /vg:review phase 1 + /vg:accept step 6b. HARD BLOCK at
accept on critical drift.

**Perf budget:** `verify-goal-perf.py` enforces p95_ms per tier declared in
TEST-GOALS `perf_budget:` block. Mutation endpoint missing budget = BLOCK.

### Phase C — Executor context isolation

`context_injection.mode: full | scoped` in config. Scoped mode extracts only
decisions listed in task's `<context-refs>P{phase}.D-XX</context-refs>`
attribute. Blueprint planner instructed to emit refs per task; executor
reads `<decision_context>` block, MUST NOT read CONTEXT.md directly.
`phase_cutover=14` auto-upgrades scoped for new phases. New validator
`verify-context-refs.py` WARNs on missing refs (advisory).

### Phase D — FOUNDATION §9 architecture lock + SECURITY-TEST-PLAN

`/vg:project` round 7 locks 8 architectural subsections in FOUNDATION.md §9
(tech stack, module boundary, folder convention, cross-cutting concerns,
security baseline, performance baseline, testing baseline, model-portable
code style). Round 8 writes `.vg/SECURITY-TEST-PLAN.md` via 4 strategic Q&A
(risk profile, DAST tool, pen-test strategy, compliance framework).
New validators `verify-foundation-architecture.py` + `verify-security-test-plan.py`
(both UNQUARANTINABLE).

Blueprint planner prompt injected with `<architecture_context>` +
`<security_test_plan>` blocks — planner sees the authoritative contract.

### Phase E — Reactive telemetry suggestions

`telemetry-suggest.py` emits 3 advisory types from events.db + telemetry.jsonl:
skip candidates (pass_rate>=0.98 + samples>=10), expensive reorder
(p95>threshold → late in sequence), override abuse warning (flag used
>=3× in 30 days → gate may need tuning).

**UNQUARANTINABLE safety:** security validators NEVER suggested for skip,
regardless of pass rate. Hardcoded safety baseline union-merged with parsed
set — parsing failure can never remove a security validator from protected
set. `--apply skip X` hard-refuses UNQUARANTINABLE. Closes "AI gaming via
reactive skip suggestions" surface.

### Phase F — Build-progress task checkpoint extension

`.build-progress.json` per-task entry now carries optional verification
fields (typecheck/test_summary/wave_verify/run_id). New helper
`vg_build_progress_is_task_fully_verified` — `/vg:recover` skips tasks with
full verification record (no re-run after compact). Backward compat:
legacy commits without these fields treated as "not fully verified"
(safer default).

### Phase G — Cost budget tracker + model portability guide

`cost-tracker.py` aggregates token_usage events per phase or milestone,
compares against config budgets (phase=500k, milestone=5M default), warns
at 80%, blocks over hard budget. Consumable by accept gate.

`.vg/MODEL-PORTABILITY.md` — doc-only artifact on cross-model consistency.
Points to FOUNDATION §9.8 model-portable style rules + CrossAI 2d-6 as
multi-model review mechanism (no new diff tool, per plan consensus).

### Phase H — Learn auto-surface + tier (UX fatigue fix)

Closes bootstrap learning loop by eliminating review-fatigue anti-pattern.
New step `6c_learn_auto_surface` at end of /vg:accept. Tiered candidates:

- **Tier A** (conf≥0.85 + impact=critical): auto-promote after 3 phase
  confirms, 1-line notification only
- **Tier B** (conf 0.6-0.85): surfaced MAX 2 per phase, 3-line y/n/e/s
  prompt each
- **Tier C** (conf<0.6): silent parking, access via `/vg:learn --review --all`
- **RETIRED** (reject_count≥2): never surfaced again

`learn-tier-classify.py` computes tier from confidence + impact + history.
`learn-dedupe.py` merges title-similar candidates (difflib ≥ 0.8) before
surface. Reflector schema extended with `impact` + `first_seen` + `reject_count`
fields.

### Phase I — Milestone pentest checklist generator

`/vg:security-audit-milestone` step 5 generates
`.vg/milestones/{M}/SECURITY-PENTEST-CHECKLIST.md` — human-curated
artifact for pentesters. Aggregates SECURITY-TEST-PLAN risk profile +
endpoints grouped by auth model + OPEN threats carry-over from
SECURITY-REGISTER + risk-profile-aware priority vectors + compliance
control mapping (SOC2 / ISO 27001 / HIPAA / GDPR / PCI-DSS predefined).
VG does NOT run pentests — curates info so humans can.

### Migration

- Phase 0-13: grandfather on all new gates (warn/skip), `context_injection.mode=full`
- Phase 14+: hard enforcement, `scoped` mode auto-upgrade via `phase_cutover=14`
- Override handlers: `--allow-verify-divergence`, `--allow-missing-security`,
  `--allow-missing-perf`, `--allow-missing-architecture`, `--allow-full-context-mode`,
  `--allow-baseline-drift`, `--skip-dast`, `--allow-dast-findings`

### Test coverage

- 198 new integration tests across 12 test files
- 530/530 regression pass (A-I cumulative, skipping 16 WSL-broken pre-existing)

### Files changed

**17 new scripts:** wave-verify-isolated, verify-goal-security, verify-goal-perf,
verify-security-baseline, verify-context-refs, verify-foundation-architecture,
verify-security-test-plan, dast-scan-report, telemetry-suggest, cost-tracker,
learn-tier-classify, learn-dedupe, generate-pentest-checklist, _i18n helper,
dast-runner.sh, etc.

**3 new templates:** SECURITY-TEST-PLAN, SECURITY-PENTEST-CHECKLIST,
TEST-GOAL-enriched (extended with security_checks + perf_budget blocks).

**1 new doc:** MODEL-PORTABILITY.md

**Skill files edited:** build.md, blueprint.md, review.md, test.md,
accept.md, project.md, learn.md, security-audit-milestone.md,
vg-executor-rules.md, vg-reflector/SKILL.md, 4 narration string keys.

**Config new keys:** `context_injection`, `cost`, `bootstrap` (auto-surface
+ tier thresholds), `security_testing.dast_*`, `visual_regression` (already
present, no change).

### Drops (out of scope per CrossAI consensus)

- Cross-model build comparison tool (reuse CrossAI 2d-6)
- `/vg:architect` new command (extended `/vg:project` round 7 instead)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` new artifact (FOUNDATION §9 instead)
- `task-frame.json` new file (extended `.build-progress.json` instead)
- R8 commit-message citation rule (conflict with R1)

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-23

### Level 5 push — close 3 autonomy gaps from v2.3 review

v2.3.1 closes the remaining gaps preventing VG from being classified as **Level 5 Autonomous Workflow Engineering**:

### Gap 1 — Dead Python scripts wired or deleted

- `bootstrap-conflict.py` (128 LoC) — now called by `/vg:learn --promote` as mandatory pre-check. Candidates with scope conflicting with active ACCEPTED rules are rejected before overlay write.
- `bootstrap-hygiene.py` (470+ LoC) — `/vg:bootstrap --health`, `--trace`, and new `--efficacy` subcommands all route here. Was previously hitting `bootstrap-loader.py` which didn't have this logic.
- `compat-check.py` (159 LoC) — wired into `/vg:update` step `4_breaking_gate`. Surfaces breaking changes within a major (renamed step markers, dropped contract fields, removed scripts).
- `vg_sync_codex.py` — **deleted.** Superseded by `generate-codex-skills.sh` (v2.3) which is now called automatically by `sync.sh`.
- `phase-metadata.py` (188 LoC) — confirmed referenced by `bootstrap-test-runner.py` + `bootstrap.md`; kept.
- `vg_migrate_goal_tags.py` — kept as one-shot migration utility (no runtime invocation by design).

### Gap 2 — Codex skill drift loop closed

- `sync.sh` now runs `generate-codex-skills.sh --force` automatically in step `1b` of every sync. Previously codex-skills were manually regenerated and drifted up to 400 lines behind Claude source (observed on `review.md` pre-2.3).
- Next sync emits `REGENERATED: codex-skills (41 skills from Claude source)` in summary.

### Gap 3 — Bootstrap outcome tracking functional

- `cmd_efficacy` in `bootstrap-hygiene.py` now **surgically mutates ACCEPTED.md** in place: rule blocks get their `hits`, `hit_outcomes.success_count`, `hit_outcomes.fail_count`, and `last_hit` timestamp updated from events.jsonl + events.db.
- Previously `--apply` only wrote to `.efficacy-log.md`; ACCEPTED.md stayed at `hits: 0` forever → self-learning system was mute.
- `accept.md` post-UAT now queries events.db for `bootstrap.rule_fired` events in the phase, emits `bootstrap.outcome_recorded` with phase verdict per rule, then auto-runs `bootstrap-hygiene.py efficacy --apply`.
- Phase success/fail attribution: derived from final UAT verdict (DEFER|REJECTED|FAILED → fail, else success).

### Tests

- `test_bootstrap_efficacy.py` +6 cases (dry-run no-mutation, --apply updates hits, multiple rules, audit log, empty events no-op, idempotent)
- **Total 77/77 targeted tests pass** (71 from v2.3 + 6 new).

### Engineering level

v2.3.1 reaches **Level 5 — Autonomous Workflow Engineering**:
1. ✅ Self-healing: dead scripts wired or deleted, distribution integrity via auto-regen
2. ✅ Auto-bootstrap learning feedback loop: rule fire → outcome attribution → efficacy → ACCEPTED.md update
3. ✅ Zero-drift distribution: sync.sh single source of truth

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-23

### OHOK hardening — close 6 performative gaps + marker forgery attack surface

v2.3 finishes the "One Hit One Kill" (OHOK) pass: specs → accept now runs end-to-end without human intervention (except UAT), with every gate backed by **actual runtime enforcement** instead of prose "AI MUST do X" with no runtime hook.

Triggered by 6 adversarial audits (2 CrossAI rounds, Codex + Gemini independent review). Prior audits found **~17 performative steps** where AI could read the rule, understand it, then silently skip. Those are all closed now.

### Added

**Forgery-resistant step markers** (Batch 5b / E1):
- `_shared/lib/marker-schema.sh` — `mark_step()` writes content `v1|{phase}|{step}|{git_sha}|{iso_ts}|{run_id}` instead of empty `touch .done`.
- `verify_marker()` checks 5 invariants: schema version, phase match, step match, `git_sha` IS ancestor of HEAD (blocks after-the-fact `touch` forgery), `iso_ts` within 30 days (blocks stale marker reuse).
- `verify_all_markers()` iterates phase dir, returns BLOCK on any forged/mismatched/schema-bad marker.
- `scripts/marker-migrate.py` one-time migration rewrites legacy empty markers with synthetic content; idempotent.
- 73 `touch` calls across 8 skill files converted to `mark_step` with graceful fallback (`|| touch …`).
- `accept.md` step `2_marker_precheck` now hard-blocks on `rc=3/4/5/6/7` (forgery/mismatch/stale), WARNs on legacy empty (configurable strict mode via `VG_MARKER_STRICT=1`).

**Batch 1 — `specs.md` 0% → 85% enforced:**
- Runtime contract frontmatter (7 markers, 2 telemetry events, forbidden flags).
- `parse_args` bash gate: `grep` ROADMAP in 3 formats (heading / table / checkbox-list `- [x] **Phase N**`).
- `generate_draft` bash gate: `case $USER_APPROVAL` with `approve`/`edit`/`discard`/unset → exit 2 on discard or unset.

**Batch 2 — `review.md` phaseP_delta/regression real verification:**
- Previously wrote PASS stubs. Now parses parent `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, extracts FAILED/BLOCKED goals, computes **per-goal** git overlap (CrossAI R6 fix: previously ONE global file set — any touched parent file false-PASSed ALL unrelated failed goals).
- Per-goal: `git log --grep=G-XX` → files → overlap check with hotfix delta. BLOCK if any failed goal with known commits has zero per-goal overlap.
- `phaseP_regression` requires `bug_ref` in SPECS + ≥1 code commit + test linkage check.
- Contract 4 → 25 markers (4 block + 21 warn via `required_unless_flag`).
- 4 new override flags: `--allow-empty-hotfix`, `--allow-orthogonal-hotfix`, `--allow-no-bugref`, `--allow-empty-bugfix`.

**Batch 3 — `accept.md` UAT quorum gate:**
- Previously `[s] Skip` on every `AskUserQuestion` → DEFERRED verdict shipped → next phase proceeds anyway. Pure theatre.
- New step `5_uat_quorum_gate` requires `.uat-responses.json`, counts critical_skips (decisions + READY goals).
- **UAT coverage cross-check (CrossAI R6 fix)**: expected decisions count from `### D-XX` headings in CONTEXT.md + expected READY goals from GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md, responses must cover all. Prevents attacker writing `{decisions: {skip: 0, total: 0}}` to trivially pass quorum.
- `--allow-uat-skips` override forces `verdict=DEFER` (propagates — next phase blocks).
- Contract 3 → 12 markers + 4 new override flags.

**Batch 4 — `build.md` real branching + context enforcement:**
- step `5_handle_branching` now real bash: `case $BRANCH_STRATEGY` phase/milestone/none with `git checkout -b` + **worktree + index** uncommitted-changes precheck (CrossAI R6: `git diff --quiet` alone missed index-only staged changes).
- step `4c` tracks `SIBLINGS_FAILED` array per-task; systemic failure (all fail) → exit 1 with diagnostic.
- Contract 8 → 18 markers.

**Batch 5 — `test.md` fix-loop counter persist + override-debt validator:**
- `5c_auto_escalate` previously had prose "max 3 iterations" with no state. Now persists `${PHASE_DIR}/.fix-loop-state.json` with `iteration_count` + `first_run_ts`. `MAX_ITER` via `vg_config_get test.max_fix_loop_iterations`. Exhausted → `test.fix_loop_exhausted` telemetry + exit.
- New `scripts/validators/check-override-events.py`:
  - Event store indexed by event_id (dict, not set) — includes gate_id metadata.
  - **gate_id binding** (CrossAI R6 critical): `resolved_by_event_id` event's gate_id must match override's gate_id. Previously: any unrelated real event could "resolve" any override.
  - `legacy: true` now requires non-empty `legacy_reason` field (previously: unconditional bypass for all pre-v1.8.0 entries).
  - Reads both `telemetry.jsonl` + `events.db` (hash-chained).

### Added — Concrete bug fixes from CrossAI Round 6

| # | Gap | File |
|---|-----|------|
| 1 | Missing ROADMAP format `- [x] **Phase N: ...**` | `specs.md` parse_args |
| 2 | `${AUTO_MODE:+auto}${AUTO_MODE:-guided}` emitted junk like `autofalse` | `specs.md` telemetry payload |
| 3 | `git diff --quiet` missed staged-only changes | `build.md` step 5 branching |
| 4 | phaseP_delta one global overlap → false-PASS all unrelated failed goals | `review.md` phaseP_delta |
| 5 | UAT responses JSON self-report trusted → trivial bypass | `accept.md` quorum gate |
| 6 | `legacy: true` = unconditional bypass | `check-override-events.py` |
| 7 | `resolved_by_event_id` didn't check gate_id | `check-override-events.py` |

### Tests

- `test_marker_forgery.py` — 16 cases (mark_step writes schema, verify rejects forgery/mismatch/stale/schema-bad, legacy lenient/strict mode, migrate script writes + idempotent)
- `test_batch5_integrity.py` — +2 (legacy_without_reason BLOCK, gate_id_mismatch BLOCK); 15/15 pass
- `test_phaseP_real_verification.py` — 15/15 pass after per-goal rewrite
- `test_uat_quorum_gate.py` — 17/17 pass after coverage gate addition
- `test_specs_contract.py` — 11/11 pass
- `test_build_gap_closure.py` — 13/13 pass
- **Total targeted: 71/71 pass.**

### Migration

One-time per project:
```bash
python .claude/scripts/marker-migrate.py --planning .vg
```

Rewrites legacy empty markers with synthetic content (phase from path, step from filename, git_sha = HEAD, iso_ts = now, run_id = `legacy-migration-{date}`). Idempotent. Backward compat: lenient mode accepts legacy empties by default; set `VG_MARKER_STRICT=1` to hard-block them.

### CrossAI Round 6 verdict

Both Codex + Gemini agreed: **BLOCK → must do Batch 5b before ship** (empty `.done` markers forgeable via synthetic `touch` sweep). v2.3 closes this. Post-migration, forged/mismatched/stale markers trigger BLOCK at accept gate with diagnostic per-step.

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Major — Orchestrator + runtime contract + anti-rationalization enforcement

v2.2 đóng gap lớn nhất của VG: AI tự-chứng thực "done" qua rationalization. Ship **trust-boundary layer** giữa AI và pipeline — AI không advance pipeline được nếu thiếu evidence runtime.

### Added

**Orchestrator layer** (`scripts/vg-orchestrator/`):
- Python CLI binary với 20+ subcommands: `run-start`, `run-complete`, `run-abort`, `run-resume`, `run-repair`, `mark-step`, `emit-event`, `wave-start`, `wave-complete`, `override`, `validate`, `verify-hash-chain`, `query-events`.
- SQLite `events.db` với hash chain (tamper-evident event log, WAL + flock concurrency).
- 5 JSON schemas: event, evidence-json, runtime-contract, override-debt-entry, validator-output.
- Runtime contract parsed từ skill-MD frontmatter (must_write, must_touch_markers, must_emit_telemetry, forbidden_without_override).

**9 validators** (`scripts/validators/`):
- `phase-exists`, `context-structure`, `plan-granularity`, `wave-attribution`, `goal-coverage`, `task-goal-binding`, `test-first`, `override-debt-balance`, `event-reconciliation`.
- **`runtime-evidence`** (v2.2 hallmark) — chặn AI mark goals READY dựa "code evidence". Yêu cầu Playwright spec phải **đã chạy** (report newer than SPECS.md mtime). Critical goals có code nhưng không runtime proof → BLOCK.
- **Validator quarantine**: 3 consecutive fails → auto-disable, emit `validation.warned` reason=quarantined. Một PASS/WARN re-enable. Safety net chống 1 validator broken stall pipeline.

**Schema validation** (`scripts/vg-orchestrator/contracts.py`): jsonschema validate runtime_contract at parse-time. Typo/structural errors surface ở load, không runtime.

**Hooks 3-layer**:
- `UserPromptSubmit`: vg-entry-hook.py registers run BEFORE skill-MD loads (AI can't skip init).
- `Stop`: vg-verify-claim.py checks runtime_contract, exit 2 = force AI continue if evidence missing.
- `PostToolUse`: existing hook preserved.

**Skill-MD v2 rewrites** (all 6 pipeline commands):
- scope.md, blueprint.md, build.md, review.md, test.md, accept.md.
- Pattern: entry block `run-start` (idempotent) + emit `{cmd}.started` + inline `mark-step` at each step + terminal block emit `{cmd}.completed` + `run-complete` gate.
- Inline commands (no bash functions — they don't persist across Claude Code Bash tool calls).

**`/vg:doctor stack`** subcommand: diagnostic script check orchestrator reachable, events.db integrity, schemas valid, validators present, hooks wired, bootstrap consistent.

### Workflow fixes

- **`--wave N` contract exemption**: partial-run mode không ép full pipeline markers (8_execute_waves, 9_post_execution, 10_postmortem_sanity, complete) + `{cmd}.completed`. Wave-by-wave checkpoint clean, không override debt.
- **Goal-coverage pipeline ordering**: gate ở review downgraded BLOCK→WARN. Validator dispatch removed from `vg:review` (runs `vg:test` + `vg:accept` where tests exist). Prevents backend-only phase deadlock.
- **Validation verdict mapping**: PASS→validation.passed, WARN→validation.warned (new event type), BLOCK→validation.failed. Prior code collapsed WARN+BLOCK misleading audit.
- **`${PHASE_DIR}` substitution**: when phase_dir=None (phase not on disk), fallback to readable `.vg/phases/{phase}-<missing>` instead of literal `${PHASE_DIR}`.
- **Literal `\n` bug** (Python injection script artifact): replaced 3 broken commands in build.md với single-line form. Same fix applied to review.md + scope.md via pattern.
- **Dedup `{cmd}.started` event**: 5 manual emits removed from skill-MDs. Orchestrator run-start auto-emit = single source.

### Changed

- All 6 pipeline skill-MDs require orchestrator subprocess at entry + exit (idempotent with UserPromptSubmit hook).
- COMMAND_VALIDATORS dispatch mapping added runtime-evidence to review + test + accept.
- Schema regex allows digits in flag names (`--allow-r5-violation` etc).

### Deprecated / Removed

- Bash function helpers `_mark()` / `_emit()` in skill-MDs — not persistent across Claude Code Bash invocations, replaced with inline commands.

### Fixed

- `validation.warned` vs `validation.failed` event distinction (phase-exists validator returned WARN was marked failed).
- `--wave N` declared but unimplemented in build.md — now gates in step 8.
- Stop hook false-fire on aborted runs (test via orchestrator state clear).

### Tests

- `scripts/tests/test_bypass_negative.py`: 10 scenarios AI could bypass orchestrator. All BLOCK correctly.
- `scripts/vg-stack-health.py`: 8-check diagnostic, exit 0 healthy / 1 warn / 2 block.

### Migration from v1.14.x

- Skill-MDs auto-upgraded via install/sync — no user action needed.
- Existing phases keep working (runtime_contract optional — old skill-MDs that lack it skip the check).
- `events.db` auto-created on first v2.2 run.
- Quarantine file `.vg/validator-quarantine.json` auto-gitignored.

### Breaking? No

- Backward-compatible: pre-v2.2 phases still process via v2 skill-MD.
- All `/vg:*` commands preserve argument-hint; added flags are opt-in.
- Hooks fail-open: if orchestrator missing, skill-MD proceeds (degraded-correct).

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added — Migrate semantic gates (real enforcement, no decoration)
- **Migrate VG semantic gates** (`commands/vg/migrate.md` step 9): enforces 4 downstream blueprint/build/test requirements:
  - CONTEXT 3-section coverage (Endpoints + UI Components + Test Scenarios per decision)
  - TEST-GOALS Rule 3b (every mutation goal has Persistence check block)
  - Surface classification (ui/api/data/integration/time-driven/custom per goal)
  - PLAN ↔ TEST-GOALS bidirectional linkage (`<goals-covered>` per task)
- **Standalone validator** (`scripts/verify-migrate-output.py`): reusable gate validator. Used by step 9 + `--self-test` + CI tooling.
- **Self-test fixture** (`fixtures/migrate/legacy-sample/`): generic legacy GSD sample with golden post-migration output. Verifies gate logic deterministically without AI agent spawn.
- **`/vg:migrate --self-test` mode**: runs validator on golden fixture, diffs vs expected report. Exit 0 = gate logic correct.
- **Step 4 strengthened**: Gate 3 now requires count-match for ALL 3 sub-sections (was Endpoints only — silent miss for Test Scenarios was downstream blocker).
- **Step 6 strengthened**: agent prompt explicitly requires Persistence check + Surface classification. Post-staging Python gate validates before promotion.
- **Step 6.5 NEW**: bidirectional PLAN ↔ TEST-GOALS linkage (mirrors blueprint step 2b5 logic).
- **Override flags**: `--allow-semantic-gaps` (emergency bypass, logs override-debt).
- **Telemetry events**: `migrate_semantic_pass`, `migrate_semantic_fail`, `migrate_self_test_pass`, `migrate_self_test_fail` visible in `/vg:gate-stats`.

### Fixed
- **Mutation evidence regex**: previously `^-` matched markdown bullet `- DOM:` as placeholder dash → real mutations counted as N/A. Fix strips bullet prefix before placeholder check.
- **Goal header pattern**: 2-4 hash levels supported (matches both `## Goal G-XX` legacy and `#### G-XX:` convention).

### Migration guidance
- Existing legacy phases (without enrichment): gates correctly identify gaps. Verified on real project: 50 missing Persistence on a single phase.
- Re-run `/vg:migrate <phase> --force` to apply enrichment with full semantic gates.
- Override path: `--allow-semantic-gaps` for known-incomplete phases (logs override-debt, surfaces in `/vg:gate-stats`).

## [1.13.2] - 2026-04-20

Thêm công cụ **UI Component Map** — vẽ cây component dạng ASCII + JSON từ code React/Vue/Svelte, dùng cho 2 mục đích:

### Mục đích

1. **Bản đồ hiện trạng (As-is map)** — khi phase sửa view đã có, script quét code hiện tại sinh `UI-MAP-AS-IS.md` để planner hiểu cấu trúc trước khi viết plan.
2. **Bản vẽ đích (To-be blueprint)** — planner viết `UI-MAP.md` chứa cây component mong muốn + JSON tree. Executor bám theo khi build. Post-wave script sinh cây thực tế → diff với UI-MAP.md → phát hiện lệch (drift) → BLOCK nếu vượt ngưỡng.

### Added

- **`scripts/generate-ui-map.mjs`** — port từ gist TongDucThanhNam (đã audit clean: chỉ đọc AST + xuất ASCII, không network/file write/exec/eval). Port từ Bun → Node 20+, bỏ hardcode `apps/mobile` + expo-router, config-driven qua `ui_map:` section trong vg.config.md. Hỗ trợ React, React Native, Vue, Svelte (qua extension detection). Auto-detect router: expo-router / next-app / react-router / tanstack-router / none.

- **`scripts/verify-ui-structure.py`** — cổng kiểm tra (gate) so sánh UI-MAP.md (kế hoạch đích) với cây thực tế. Phân loại lệch thành MISSING (thiếu), UNEXPECTED (dư thừa), LAYOUT_SHIFT (lệch bố cục). Ngưỡng cấu hình qua `ui_map.max_missing` / `max_unexpected` / `layout_advisory`.

- **`commands/vg/_shared/templates/UI-MAP-template.md`** — mẫu cho planner viết UI-MAP.md với cây ASCII (người đọc) + JSON tree (máy so sánh).

### Wired vào pipeline

- **`blueprint.md`** sub-step mới `2b6b_ui_map` (profile web-fullstack/web-frontend-only): nếu phase có task FE, sinh UI-MAP-AS-IS.md (nếu sửa view cũ) → planner viết UI-MAP.md (to-be).
- **`build.md`** step 10 bổ sung drift check: sau post-mortem + goal coverage, chạy generate-ui-map.mjs trên code vừa build → verify-ui-structure.py diff với UI-MAP.md → warn nếu lệch.
- **`templates/vg/vg.config.template.md`** thêm section `ui_map:` (enabled, src, entry, router, aliases, max_missing, max_unexpected, layout_advisory).

### Rule tiếng Việt tăng cường (term-glossary.md)

User báo "AI không tuân theo" rule v1.14.0+ về VN-first narration. Nguyên nhân: rule viết cho command output, AI hiểu nhầm không áp dụng chat reply.

Thêm section mới "RULE v1.14.0+ R2 (2026-04-20 reinforce — AI narration)":
- Áp dụng cho mọi reply của AI trong session VG (không chỉ command output)
- Bảng 15 term hay vi phạm với bản thay tiếng Việt (CONFIRMED→XÁC NHẬN, Verdict→Kết luận, Audit→Rà soát, Drift→Lệch hướng, Root cause→Nguyên nhân gốc, v.v.)
- Yêu cầu cứng: trước khi gửi reply > 50 từ hoặc có bảng markdown, AI tự đếm term EN, > 2 → rewrite
- Kèm 2 ví dụ AI đã vi phạm trong session 2026-04-19 → sửa đúng

### Relation với artifacts UI hiện có (không đè)

- `design-normalized/` (từ `/vg:design-extract`) = nguồn thiết kế gốc (screenshots + DOM raw)
- `DESIGN.md` (từ `/vg:design-system`) = quy chuẩn style (color/typography/spacing)
- `UI-SPEC.md` (từ blueprint step 2b6_ui_spec) = spec design token cấp phase
- **`UI-MAP.md` (MỚI)** = cây component cụ thể cho từng view — contract cho executor
- **`UI-MAP-AS-IS.md` (MỚI)** = cây hiện trạng của code cũ (generated)

Bốn artifact bổ sung nhau.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-04-19

Post-Phase-10 adversarial audit fixes. User feedback: "code chưa gọn, không dùng graphify, sinh duplicate, sai goals". Audit confirmed graphify stale 10h during Phase 10 build + 0 telemetry events + goals declared without test traceability. Root cause: `(recovered)` commits from manual recovery bypassed skill framework entirely.

### Added (observability + enforcement)

- **`commands/vg/_shared/lib/graphify-safe.sh`** — hardened graphify rebuild wrapper. `vg_graphify_rebuild_safe()` records mtime before rebuild, verifies mtime advanced after, retries once on stuck. Previous silent failures (audit observed graph.json unchanged despite rebuild call) now emit LOUD warnings + `graphify_rebuild_failed` telemetry. `vg_graphify_assert_rebuilt_since()` checkpoint helper for call sites that expect rebuild to have occurred.

- **`commands/vg/_shared/lib/build-postmortem.sh`** — end-of-build sanity gate. `vg_build_postmortem_check()` verifies: (a) telemetry events exist for phase, (b) wave-start tags present, (c) no `(recovered)` commits bypassing gates, (d) step markers written. Emits `build_postmortem_ok` or `build_postmortem_issues` event. Warns, doesn't block (review is enforcement point).

- **`scripts/verify-goal-coverage-phase.py`** — phase-level goal→test binding audit. Complements existing per-task `verify-goal-test-binding.py` by scanning ALL test files (not just per-commit diff) for `TS-XX` markers and cross-referencing TEST-GOALS.md. Catches: goals declared but never tested, orphan TS markers (tests for removed goals), deferred goal handling via `verification: deferred|manual` annotation.

### Wired into existing commands

- **`commands/vg/build.md`** step 4 — replaces direct `_rebuild_code` call with `vg_graphify_rebuild_safe`. Step 4 rebuild silent-fail bug closed.
- **`commands/vg/build.md`** new step 10 (`10_postmortem_sanity`) — runs post-mortem + phase-level goal coverage audit. Advisory at build end, flags for review.
- **`commands/vg/blueprint.md`** step 2a — same safe wrapper replaces direct rebuild call.
- **`commands/vg/review.md`** step 0b (`0b_goal_coverage_gate`) — enforces goal coverage gate. BLOCK unless `--skip-goal-coverage` override (which logs to OVERRIDE-DEBT register).
- **`commands/vg/review.md`** Phase 1.5 — safe wrapper before ripple analysis.

### Deployed into RTB, verified against Phase 10

Ran `verify-goal-coverage-phase.py --phase-dir .vg/phases/10-deal-management-dsp-partners`:
- 14/15 goals bound to `apps/api/src/modules/deals/__tests__/deal-integration.test.ts`
- 1 unbound: `G-00` (typically inherited/milestone-level, should be `verification: deferred`)
- 3 orphan: `TS-15`, `TS-16`, `TS-17` (tests for non-declared goals)

Confirms audit findings: Phase 10 had real goal-test traceability gaps that would've been caught if gates weren't bypassed via recovery.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-19

Major workflow upgrade: adaptive typecheck + generic cache bootstrap + tsgo integration + Utility Contract Layer 2+3 + agent resilience. Hardened via real-run test on RTB apps/web (1157-file TS project) that exposed 807 pre-existing errors previously invisible due to tsc OOM.

### Added (features)

- **Adaptive typecheck strategy** (`_shared/lib/typecheck-light.sh`) — cache-first decision tree: OOM history → narrow; warm → incremental; cold small → incremental direct; cold medium/large → bootstrap first → incremental warm. Auto-selects based on file count + cache presence + OOM history (7-day window). Portable knobs in config: `typecheck_adaptive.{smallThreshold,largeThreshold,heapMB}`.
- **Generic cache bootstrap** (`vg_typecheck_cache_bootstrap`) — 3 strategies auto-selected by detection chain:
  1. **tsgo** — if `@typescript/native-preview` on PATH (Rust re-impl, 10-20x faster, 1/5 RAM). Strategy fires first in both adaptive incremental AND bootstrap paths.
  2. **watch** — spawn `tsc -w` background, poll for `.tsbuildinfo` write every 5s, Windows `_vg_kill_tree` cleanup.
  3. **chunked** — split tsconfig.include into N-file chunks with auto-fit (÷4 when total ≤ original chunk_size).
  Portable via `templates/vg/vg.config.template.md` new `typecheck_adaptive:` section.
- **`/vg:extract-utils` command** — one-shot duplicate helper extraction. Modes: `--scan` (default read-only), `--extract <name>`, `--interactive` (multi-select), `--all`. Reads canonical package from PROJECT.md Shared Utility Contract table, extracts atomically with per-commit rollback on typecheck fail.
- **Utility Contract System Layer 2+3** — prevents new duplicates:
  - Layer 2a: `/vg:scope` Round 2 utility classifier (REUSE/EXTEND/NEW)
  - Layer 2b: `scripts/verify-utility-reuse.py` blueprint gate (BLOCKs if task redeclares contract name)
  - Layer 3a: executor grep-before-declare rule in `vg-executor-rules.md`
  - Layer 3b: `scripts/verify-utility-duplication.py` post-wave scan (AST, weighted .ts/.tsx*3, skips handle*/on*/render* prefixes)
- **Agent resilience M2+M3** — `build-progress.sh` self-register (agents check `.build-progress.json` + self-call start if missing) + stuck-agent detection (>600s in-flight OR >120s critical section).
- **H3 @deferred test markers** — `scripts/scan-deferred-tests.py` parses `it.skip('TS-XX ...', () => { // @deferred reason })` in 4 variants → appends "Deferred tests" section to GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md so tests marked deferred don't silently drop goals.

### Fixed (gaps)

- **H1 integrity auto-run post-wave** — `verify-wave-integrity.py` now invoked automatically at build step 0c (previously had to be run manually).
- **H2 wave override → OVERRIDE-DEBT register** — 6 new call sites log overrides (attribution, integrity, hard-gate, final-unit-suite, regression, missing-summaries). Audit trail for every skip decision.
- **L1 plan package-scope check** — `scripts/verify-plan-paths.py` greps PLAN for `@scope/name`, cross-refs repo package.json, flags mismatches with nearest-match suggestions.
- **L2 registration list expansion** — `scripts/verify-commit-attribution.py` REGISTRATION_FILENAMES extended: routes.ts, plugins.ts, schema.ts, types.ts, api.rs, routes.rs, handlers.rs, main.go, main.py.
- **Cache bootstrap hardening** — caught in real run:
  - Windows orphan `tsc -w` process (15GB RAM) — `kill $!` hit npx wrapper not grandchild. Fix: `_vg_kill_tree` using `taskkill //F //PID` scanning node.exe >2GB.
  - Chunked degenerate case: 381 files with chunk=400 = 1 chunk = OOM. Fix: auto-fit `(total + 3) / 4` when total ≤ original chunk_size.
  - OOM detection gap: rc 134/137 in chunked loop not recognized → never logged. Fix: explicit rc check per chunk, append to `.tsbuildinfo-oom-log`.

### Real-run validation

Battle-tested on RTB apps/web:
- Before: tsc cold OOM forever at 32GB heap, narrow-mode only saw 10 errors.
- After: tsgo cold ~2min (48GB peak, writes .tsbuildinfo), **warm 1 second full type check**, exposed 807 real errors (previously invisible tech debt).
- Zero config change beyond 2 tsconfig lines (remove baseUrl, prefix paths with `./`).
- Backward compat with tsc 5.9 verified.

### Install hint for VG projects

`npm install -g @typescript/native-preview` — workflow auto-detects via `_vg_cache_detect_tsgo`. Template config lists tsgo as preferred strategy out of the box.

## [1.12.6] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed (config audit stop-gap)
- **Patched 10 missing config fields** workflow reads but `/vg:project` doesn't generate. Without these, dotted notation `${config.X.Y}` returns empty string in awk parser → silent fallback to defaults that may not match user environment. Added with sensible defaults:
  - `db_name`, `dev_failure_log_tail`, `dev_failure_patterns`, `dev_os_limits`, `dev_process_markers` (dev-server startup detection)
  - `error_response_shape` (flat alias for skills not using `contract_format.` prefix)
  - `i18n.{enabled,default_locale,key_function,locale_dir}` (translation key extraction)
  - `ports.database` (flat alias for worktree_ports)
  - `rationalization_guard.model` (gate-skip subagent model)
  - `surfaces.web` (multi-surface routing default — single-surface fallback)

### Audit doc
`.vg/CONFIG-AUDIT.md` — full analysis: 44 keys workflow READS vs 43 keys current config WRITES. Diff shows 11 read-but-missing (10 real + 1 false positive `template.md` = file path).

### Planned for v1.13.0
- **Template-based config generation** — `/vg:project` reads `vgflow/vg.config.template.md` (754 lines, full schema) as source-of-truth, substitutes only foundation-derived fields. Replaces current placeholder heredoc + 12-row derivation table that covers ~25% of schema. Result: 100% schema coverage on fresh project init.

### User-reported issue
"file config của vg nhiều thông số thế, khi chạy project xong, nó có tạo đủ field không, hay lại lỗi" — confirmed: project skill at line 887-892 uses placeholder `# Write ...` heredoc with no concrete schema, relies on AI to derive from 12 rules covering ~25% of fields. Stop-gap patches current project + plan v1.13.0 fix.

## [1.12.5] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed (graphify integrity audit)
- **BUG #1: blueprint 2a5 missing --graphify-graph flag** — `build-caller-graph.py` was called without graphify, falling back to grep-only (misses path-alias imports like `@/hooks/X`, misses cross-monorepo callers). Now passes `--graphify-graph $GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH` when active + warns if enrichment unexpectedly fails.
- **BUG #2: blueprint never auto-rebuilt graphify** — only `/vg:build` did. Planner planned against stale graph (we observed 46h / 140 commits stale at audit) → references symbols that no longer exist. Now mirrors build's auto-rebuild block at start of step 2a (before planner spawn).
- **BUG #3: review Phase 1.5 ripple ran on stale graph** — no rebuild check before ripple analysis → false "0 callers affected" verdicts. Now always rebuilds before ripple (review = safety net, must be accurate).
- **BUG #4: stale warning was fire-and-forget** — `echo "⚠ Graph stale"` only, no telemetry, no block. Now emits `graphify_stale_detected` telemetry event + adds `graphify.block_on_stale: false` config knob (opt-in fail-closed mode).

### Added
- **graphify_auto_rebuild telemetry event** — emitted by blueprint step 2a + review Phase 1.5 when auto-rebuild fires. Consumable by `/vg:health` and `/vg:telemetry`.
- **graphify.block_on_stale config knob** — when `true`, config-loader exits 1 if graph stale (commits_since > staleness_warn_commits). Default `false` for backward compat.

### Audit doc
`.vg/GRAPHIFY-AUDIT.md` — full per-consumer audit (build / blueprint / review / accept / scope / migrate) with severity-ranked fix priority. Surfaces 6 issues remaining as MED/LOW priority for v1.12.6+:
- GAP: scope round 2 (technical) doesn't query graph for module impact
- GAP: /vg:health doesn't surface graphify staleness section
- LOW: planner-rules.md should require `<edits-*>` annotations on every code-touching task (Phase 13 retro: 22 tasks, only 3 had edits annotations → 19 tasks had zero blast-radius coverage)

### User-reported issue
"dữ liệu graphify thì bị out date, rất nguy hiểm" — confirmed: graph was 46 hours / 140 commits stale during phase 13 blueprint, planner had no graphify context at all (just grep). All 4 critical+high fixes patch the silent-staleness anti-pattern.

## [1.12.4] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **review: VERDICT-AWARE next-steps block (mandatory)** — `/vg:review` close-out message MUST include verdict-specific actionable commands (PASS / FLAG / BLOCK paths). Per-finding format MUST be `[Severity] one-line + ↳ Fix + ↳ Verify + ↳ Refs`. Closing MUST list 2+ labeled options (A/B/C: re-review after fix / amend scope / fix infra / dispute verdict).
- **review: Hard rules for AI orchestrator (Claude/Codex/Gemini)** — never end BLOCK without per-finding fixes. Use RELATIVE paths in narration (absolute paths waste 60% terminal width). Surface "executor cannot run X" failures explicitly, not buried.

Reason: user reported Codex /vg:review output for Phase 08 listed 7 BLOCK findings + wrote 2 artifact files but had NO actionable next steps — just bare list. User had to re-derive what to fix and how. Closing message now mandates concrete commands per finding + per-verdict routing.

Source: vietdev99/vgflow user feedback (image-cache attachment, session 2026-04-18)
## [1.12.3] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed (bug-reporter delivery)
- **bug-reporter: gh CLI hard requirement** — removed misleading URL fallback. Previously when labels missing or gh auth failing, bug-reporter generated a github.com/issues/new URL and marked the bug as "sent" in cache. Result: bugs never reached GitHub but appeared delivered. Now: gh missing → consent prompt auto-disables bug_reporting + recommends install. gh present + create fails → bug stays in queue (not silently lost).
- **bug-reporter: auto-create labels** — `bug_reporter_ensure_labels` creates `bug-auto`/`needs-triage` labels on first issue create failure (404 label not found), then retries.
- **bug-reporter: report_bug arg-shape guard** — validates severity arg against `info|minor|medium|high|critical` enum + warns on non-standard type. Previously: arg-order swap silently passed long context as severity → `_severity_gte` failed → bug queued never sent. Reported as issue #7 (sig 3aba6b9d).
- **bug-reporter: `report_bug` doc comments** — clarified positional arg semantics with examples of correct vs wrong call patterns.

### Added
- **blueprint: Recommended-pattern requirement** — when escalating CrossAI concerns to user via AskUserQuestion, orchestrator MUST present recommended option first with " (Recommended)" suffix + WHY explanation in description. Stops "list 3 options, force user to re-derive analysis CrossAI just did" anti-pattern.

### Bug telemetry

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-18

### R5 — Auto Bug Reporting + Codex skills full sync (31 missing skills generated)

**Motivation 1:** User feedback: "có cách nào để chúng ta phát triển hệ thống tự phát hiện lỗi của workflow, và đẩy về git issue được không nhỉ" — distributed bug collection. When other users run VG on different projects/envs, AI-detected bugs (like dim-expander schema bug found in v1.10.0 live test) auto-report to vietdev99/vgflow GitHub issues.

**Motivation 2:** "cập nhật vào codex skill cho tôi nhé, hình như chưa cập nhật đâu" — codex-skills folder lagged: only 5 skills (accept/next/progress/review/test). Missing 31 commands including ALL v1.9-v1.10 features.

### Features

**1. `/vg:bug-report` command** — lifecycle (flush/queue/disable/enable/stats/test)

**2. `bug-reporter.sh` lib** (~370 LOC, 15 functions):
- Consent flow + 3-tier send (gh CLI → URL fallback → silent queue)
- Generic event reporting + bug + telemetry types
- Schema validators for dim-expander + answer-challenger output
- User pushback detector (keywords: nhầm/sai/bug/wrong/không đúng)
- Redaction (paths/project name/emails/phase IDs)
- Dedup (local cache + GitHub issue search)
- Rate limit (max 5 events/session)
- Auto-assign vietdev99 + label `bug-auto`/`needs-triage`

**3. Install/update tracing** — `install.sh` prompts consent at end, writes config block, sends `install_success` event

**4. Detection types (broader scope)**:
- `schema_violation` — JSON output mismatch
- `helper_error` — bash exit ≠ 0 (v1.11.1 trap ERR integration)
- `user_pushback` — AskUserQuestion answer keywords
- `gate_loop` — challenger/expander max_rounds (v1.11.2)
- `ai_inconsistency` — same input → different output (v1.11.2)

**5. Privacy** — opt-out default + auto-redact PII before upload:
- `D:/.../RTB/...` → `{project_path}/...`
- "VollxSSP" → `<project-name>`
- `phase-13-dsp-...` → `phase-{id}`
- email → `<email>`

### Codex skills full sync

**`scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh`** — auto-generates `codex-skills/vg-X/SKILL.md` from `commands/vg/X.md`:
- Wraps with `<codex_skill_adapter>` prelude (Claude→Codex tool mapping)
- Run: `bash scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh [--force]`

**Generated 31 skills** (was 5, now 36 total):
add-phase, amend, blueprint, bug-report, build, design-extract, design-system, doctor, gate-stats, health, init, integrity, map, migrate, override-resolve, phase, prioritize, project, reapply-patches, recover, regression, remove-phase, roadmap, scope, scope-review, security-audit-milestone, setup-mobile, specs, sync, telemetry, update.

Deployed to `~/.codex/skills/` (global) + project `.codex/skills/` via `vgflow/sync.sh`.

### Files

- **NEW** `commands/vg/bug-report.md`
- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/lib/bug-reporter.sh` (~370 LOC, 15 functions)
- **NEW** `scripts/generate-codex-skills.sh`
- **NEW** `codex-skills/vg-{31 dirs}/SKILL.md`
- **MODIFIED** `install.sh` — consent prompt + config block + install event
- **BUMP** `VERSION` 1.10.1 → 1.11.0

### Migration

Existing projects:
- Run `/vg:bug-report` to trigger consent prompt + populate config
- Or manually add `bug_reporting:` block

Re-installs:
- `install.sh` prompts consent at install end
- Default opt-IN, easy disable: `/vg:bug-report --disable-all`

### Known Limitations (defer v1.11.x)

- Helper error trap auto-integration (v1.11.1)
- AI orchestrator inline pushback detection prompts (v1.11.2)
- Telemetry weekly batch aggregator (v1.12.0)

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-18

### R4 — Design System integration + Multi-surface project support

**Motivation:** UI của các phase hay bị drift — mỗi phase AI tự ý pick tokens/colors/fonts khác nhau → inconsistent look across project. User request: tích hợp [getdesign.md](https://getdesign.md/) ecosystem (58 brand DESIGN.md variants) để chuẩn hoá UI theo design system chọn.

Phát sinh thêm requirement trong discussion:
1. **Multi-design** — project có nhiều role (SSP Admin, DSP Admin, Publisher, Advertiser) có thể có design khác nhau
2. **Multi-surface** — 1 dự án có cả webserver + webclient + iOS + Android, workflow cần phân biệt phase theo surface

### Features

**1. `/vg:design-system` command (NEW)**

Lifecycle management for DESIGN.md files:
- `--browse` — list 58 brands grouped into 9 categories (AI/LLM, DevTools, Backend, Productivity, Design, Fintech, E-commerce, Media, Automotive)
- `--import <brand> [--role=<name>]` — download brand DESIGN.md to project/role location
- `--create [--role=<name>]` — guided discussion to build custom DESIGN.md (8 questions: personality, primary color, typography, radius, shadow, spacing, motion, component style)
- `--view [--role=<name>]` — print current DESIGN.md (resolved by priority)
- `--edit [--role=<name>]` — open in $EDITOR
- `--validate [--scan=<path>]` — check code hex codes vs DESIGN.md palette, report drift

**2. Multi-design resolution (4-tier priority)**

```
1. Phase-level:    .planning/phases/XX/DESIGN.md   ← highest priority
2. Role-level:     .planning/design/{role}/DESIGN.md
3. Project default: .planning/design/DESIGN.md
4. None:           scope Round 4 prompts user to pick/import/create
```

Helper `design_system_resolve PHASE_DIR ROLE` returns applicable path, respecting priority.

**3. Multi-surface project config**

New `surfaces:` block in vg.config.md for projects với nhiều platform:

```yaml
surfaces:
  api:     { type: "web-backend-only",  stack: "fastify", paths: ["apps/api"] }
  web:     { type: "web-frontend-only", stack: "react",   paths: ["apps/web"],
             design: "default" }
  ios:     { type: "mobile-native-ios", stack: "swift",   paths: ["apps/ios"],
             design: "ios-native" }
  android: { type: "mobile-native-android", stack: "kotlin", paths: ["apps/android"],
             design: "android-native" }
```

Scope Round 2 new gate: if `surfaces:` declared → user multi-select which surfaces phase touches. Lock as `P{phase}.D-surfaces: [web, api]` decision. Design resolution picks design from surface's `design:` field.

**4. Scope Round 4 integration**

Before asking UI questions:
```bash
source design-system.sh
DESIGN_RESOLVED=$(design_system_resolve "$PHASE_DIR" "$SURFACE_ROLE")
```

- **Resolved** → inject DESIGN.md content into Round 4 AskUserQuestion. User pages/components follow palette + typography + spacing
- **Not resolved** → offer 3 options:
  1. Pick from 58 brands
  2. Import existing
  3. Create from scratch
  4. Skip (flag as "design-debt")

**5. Build integration (enabled via config `inject_on_build: true`)**

`/vg:build` detects UI tasks → injects resolved DESIGN.md into task prompt. Agent must respect palette — commit body cites "Per DESIGN.md Section 2 — Primary Purple #533afd".

**6. Review Phase 2.5 integration (enabled via `validate_on_review: true`)**

`design_system_validate_tokens` scans `apps/web/src` for hex codes, compares against DESIGN.md palette, reports drift (code uses color not in palette). Non-blocking warn.

### Dimension-expander cap fix (v1.9.6 observation)

**Problem:** During live v1.9.5 test, dimension-expander generated 6-10 critical items per round → user fatigue risk for full 5-round scope + deep probe.

**Fix:** Prompt updated with explicit CAP RULE:
> Cap critical_missing at MAX 4 items. Pick the 4 MOST impactful ship-blockers. Push others to nice_to_have_missing. Rationale: avoid decision fatigue.

Verified during live scope Round 4 test — Opus respected cap (4 critical + 11 nice-to-have vs earlier 10+ critical unbounded).

### Source: Meliwat/awesome-design-md-pre-paywall

Official `VoltAgent/awesome-design-md` (getdesign.md) moved content behind paywall. Workflow defaults to `Meliwat/awesome-design-md-pre-paywall` fork (free, 58 brands snapshot pre-2026-04). User can override `config.design_system.source_repo` to use official or custom fork.

### Files

- **NEW** `commands/vg/design-system.md` (256 LOC) — lifecycle command
- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/lib/design-system.sh` (250 LOC) — 8 functions (resolve/browse/fetch/list_roles/inject_context/validate_tokens/browse_grouped/enabled)
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/scope.md` — Round 2 multi-surface gate + Round 4 DESIGN.md injection
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/_shared/lib/dimension-expander.sh` — prompt CAP RULE
- **MODIFIED** `vg.config.template.md` — `surfaces:` + `design_system:` + `review.scanner_spawn_mode` blocks
- **BUMP** `VERSION` 1.9.5 → 1.10.0 (minor bump — new feature)

### Migration

Auto via `/vg:update` (3-way merge). Existing projects without multi-surface will keep `profile:` single-value behavior. Projects adopting design system:
1. Run `/vg:design-system --browse` to see brands
2. Pick brand: `/vg:design-system --import linear`
3. Existing phases automatically detect `.planning/design/DESIGN.md` on next `/vg:scope` run

### Example workflow

```bash
# Multi-role project (VollxSSP-style with 4 dashboards)
/vg:design-system --import stripe --role=ssp-admin       # SSP Admin → Stripe
/vg:design-system --import linear --role=dsp-admin       # DSP Admin → Linear
/vg:design-system --import notion --role=publisher       # Publisher → Notion
/vg:design-system --import vercel --role=advertiser      # Advertiser → Vercel

# Multi-platform project (web + mobile)
# Edit vg.config.md to declare surfaces with design mapping
# Scope each phase picks correct DESIGN.md based on surface/role
```

## [1.9.5] - 2026-04-18

### R3.4 — Subagent sandbox isolation fix (BUG phát hiện qua live test v1.9.3)

**Bug:** Khi test v1.9.3 adversarial challenger + dimension expander trong `/vg:scope 13`, phát hiện rằng Task subagents (spawned qua Agent tool) có **sandbox isolation** — không đọc được `/tmp` files của parent process. Workflow v1.9.3 documented pattern: "helper writes prompt to /tmp, orchestrator reads path, passes path to Task tool". Subagent receives path nhưng không thể đọc file → fail với "Prompt file not found".

**Impact:** Cả 2 v1.9.3 features (8-lens adversarial + dimension-expander) không hoạt động nếu orchestrator follow documented pattern literally. Workaround: orchestrator phải đọc file content via Read tool FIRST, then pass content inline. Nhưng docs không nói rõ step này → dev sẽ fail khi dispatch Task với path.

### Fix

**answer-challenger.sh + dimension-expander.sh — emit prompt CONTENT on fd 3 (không phải path):**

Helper vẫn write tmp file (để audit/debug), nhưng fd 3 giờ emit FULL PROMPT CONTENT thay vì path:

```bash
# Before (v1.9.3):
echo "$prompt_path" >&3

# After (v1.9.5):
cat "$prompt_path" >&3
```

Orchestrator pattern đổi từ:
```bash
# OLD (broken)
PATH=$(challenge_answer ... 3>&1 1>/dev/null)
# Then: Read file at PATH, pass to Agent
```

Sang:
```bash
# NEW (works)
PROMPT=$(challenge_answer "$answer" "$round" "$scope" "$acc" 3>&1 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null)
# $PROMPT = full inline content, pass directly to Agent(prompt=$PROMPT)
```

**scope.md docs updated:** Explicit bash pattern + explanation "subagent sandbox can't read /tmp" + thay tất cả "Read the prompt file" references bằng "Capture fd 3 via pattern".

### Test verification

```bash
source answer-challenger.sh
PROMPT=$(challenge_answer "test" "r1" "phase-scope" "acc" 3>&1 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null)
echo "${#PROMPT}"  # → 6473 chars (full prompt content)
echo "${PROMPT:0:80}"  # → "You are an Adversarial Answer Challenger. You have ZERO context..."

source dimension-expander.sh
PROMPT=$(expand_dimensions "1" "Domain" "acc" ".planning/FOUNDATION.md" 3>&1 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null)
echo "${#PROMPT}"  # → 6010 chars
```

### Files

- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/_shared/lib/answer-challenger.sh` — fd 3 emits CONTENT via `cat "$prompt_path" >&3` (was path)
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/_shared/lib/dimension-expander.sh` — same pattern
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/scope.md` — updated orchestrator instructions with explicit bash capture pattern + subagent sandbox explanation
- **BUMP** `VERSION` 1.9.4 → 1.9.5

### Migration

Auto via `/vg:update` (3-way merge). Projects với custom scope orchestration phải update pattern từ path-based sang content-based. Recommend re-read updated scope.md.

### Lesson learned

**Test v1.9.3 features end-to-end là cần thiết.** Unit test passing không đảm bảo orchestration pattern works trong real Claude Code harness. Live scope test phát hiện bug ngay round 2 — shipped v1.9.5 trong 15 min sau phát hiện.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-04-18

### R3.3 — Scanner spawn mode (mobile sequential gate) + README rewrite

**Problem:** `/vg:review` Phase 2b-2 luôn spawn N Haiku scanner agents parallel (1 per view). Với mobile apps (iOS simulator, Android emulator, physical device), chỉ có ONE instance chạy được tại một thời điểm — parallel spawn gây state corruption / crash / conflicting app state. Với CLI/library projects, spawn UI scan là waste hoàn toàn (không có UI).

**Fix: `review.scanner_spawn_mode` config — 4 modes:**

| Mode         | Behavior                                              | Use case                         |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `auto`       | Derive từ profile (default)                           | Let workflow decide              |
| `parallel`   | Tất cả Agent() calls trong ONE tool_use block        | web-* (multi-browser contexts)   |
| `sequential` | Mỗi Agent() call trong SEPARATE message, await each  | mobile-* (single-emulator/device)|
| `none`       | Skip entire spawn loop, write empty scan-manifest    | cli-tool, library (no UI)        |

**Auto-derivation logic (profile → mode):**
- `mobile-rn` / `mobile-flutter` / `mobile-native-ios` / `mobile-native-android` / `mobile-hybrid` → **sequential**
- `cli-tool` / `library` → **none**
- `web-fullstack` / `web-frontend-only` / `web-backend-only` / default → **parallel**

Override: user set `scanner_spawn_mode: "sequential"` force serialize even on web (e.g., CI with constrained browser resources).

**Narration updated:**
- `parallel`: "🌐 Parallel mode — up to 5 Haiku agents concurrent"
- `sequential`: "📱 Sequential mode — 1 Haiku agent at a time (mobile/single-window constraint). Tổng N view sẽ scan tuần tự"
- `none`: "⏭  Spawn mode=none — skipping Phase 2b-2 entirely (profile has no UI scan). Backend goals resolved via surface probes in Phase 4a instead."

### README rewrite — heavy-workflow positioning

Both `README.md` và `README.vi.md` được rewrite để phản ánh đúng vị thế của VGFlow:

- **Heavy AI Workflow** banner — không phải "hỏi AI sửa file", mà pipeline production-grade
- **Supported project types** clear: Web apps / Web servers / CLI tools / Mobile apps (RN/Flutter/native)
- **Token cost transparency**: `/vg:scope` $0.15-0.30, `/vg:build` $0.50-2.00, `/vg:review` $0.30-0.80, `/vg:test` $0.20-0.50
- **When VGFlow shine / KHÔNG phù hợp** sections — honest positioning
- **14 power features** detail:
  1. Multi-tier AI Orchestration (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
  2. CrossAI N-reviewer Consensus (Claude/Codex GPT/Gemini)
  3. Contract-Aware Wave Parallel Execution
  4. Goal-Backward Verification với Weighted Gates
  5. 8-Lens Adversarial Scope + Dimension Expander (v1.9.3)
  6. Phase Profile System (6 types)
  7. Block Resolver 4 Levels (L1→L4)
  8. Live Browser Discovery (MCP Playwright) — mobile-aware
  9. 3-Way Git Merge Updates
  10. SHA256 Artifact Manifest + Atomic Commits
  11. Structured Telemetry + Override Debt Register
  12. Rationalization Guard (anti-corner-cutting)
  13. Visual Regression + Security Register (STRIDE+OWASP)
  14. Foundation Drift Detection + Incremental Graphify

### Files

- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/review.md` — SPAWN_MODE_RESOLUTION block + branch logic (parallel/sequential/none) + SPAWN_MODE aware Limits section
- **MODIFIED** `vg.config.template.md` — `review.scanner_spawn_mode: "auto"` key added
- **REWRITE** `README.md` — heavy workflow positioning, 14-feature highlight, mobile/cli support section
- **REWRITE** `README.vi.md` — mirror of English rewrite, Vietnamese translation
- **BUMP** `VERSION` 1.9.3 → 1.9.4

### Migration

Auto via `/vg:update` (3-way merge). Existing `review:` section in user config gets `scanner_spawn_mode` key added to new block; existing `fix_routing` block preserved. Fresh install defaults to `auto` which is safe for all profiles.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-04-18

### R3.2 — Scope Adversarial Upgrade + Dimension Expander

**Problem:** v1.9.1 R3 shipped `answer-challenger` với default model `haiku`. User phản hồi: scope là nơi tìm gap + critique, cần reasoning cao nhất mới phát hiện được gap thật (security threat, failure mode, integration break). Haiku reasoning depth không đủ → challenges nông, dễ miss.

**Problem 2:** Challenger trả lời câu hỏi "is this answer wrong?" nhưng thiếu câu hỏi quan trọng khác: "what haven't we discussed yet?". Proactive dimension expansion bị miss — user phải tự nhớ hỏi security/perf/failure mode cho mỗi round.

### 2 fixes shipped cùng release

**Fix A: answer-challenger — Haiku → Opus + 4→8 lenses**

- Default `scope.adversarial_model`: `haiku` → `opus` (user có thể override về haiku nếu quota căng)
- Prompt mở rộng từ 4 → 8 lenses:
  - L1 Contradiction (giữ)
  - L2 Hidden assumption (giữ)
  - L3 Edge case (giữ)
  - L4 Foundation conflict (giữ)
  - **L5 Security threat NEW** — auth/authz bypass, data leak, injection, CSRF, rate-limit bypass
  - **L6 Performance budget NEW** — unbounded query, blocking call, cache miss cost, p95 latency
  - **L7 Failure mode NEW** — idempotency, timeout, circuit breaker, partial failure, poison message, retry storm
  - **L8 Integration chain NEW** — downstream caller contract, upstream dep guarantee, webhook retry, data contract, schema migration
- Priority order when multiple fire: Security > Failure > Contradiction > Foundation > Integration > Edge > Hidden > Performance
- `issue_kind` enum mở rộng: `security | performance | failure_mode | integration_chain` (ngoài 4 cũ)
- Dispatcher narration Vietnamese cho 4 kind mới (bảo mật/perf budget/failure mode/integration chain)

**Fix B: dimension-expander NEW — proactive per-round gap finding**

NEW `_shared/lib/dimension-expander.sh` (~350 LOC, `bash -n` clean):

- Trigger: END của mỗi round (1-5 + deep probe) sau khi Q&A + adversarial challenges complete
- Model: Opus (config `scope.dimension_expand_model`, default `opus`)
- Prompt: zero-context subagent nhận ROUND_TOPIC + accumulated answers + FOUNDATION → tự derive 8-12 dimensions cho topic → classify ADDRESSED/PARTIAL/MISSING → phân loại CRITICAL vs NICE-TO-HAVE
- Output JSON: `dimensions_total`, `dimensions_addressed`, `critical_missing[]`, `nice_to_have_missing[]`
- Dispatcher: narrate gaps trong VN, AskUserQuestion 3 options (Address/Acknowledge/Defer), telemetry event `scope_dimension_expanded`
- Loop guard: `dimension_expand_max: 6` (5 rounds + 1 deep probe)
- **Complementary, not redundant** với answer-challenger:
  - Challenger: per-answer, "is this specific answer wrong?"
  - Expander: per-round, "what dimensions haven't we discussed?"

### Config changes

Thêm vào `scope:` section:
```yaml
scope:
  adversarial_model: "opus"              # was "haiku"
  dimension_expand_check: true           # NEW master switch
  dimension_expand_model: "opus"         # NEW
  dimension_expand_max: 6                # NEW loop guard
```

Thêm `review:` section (v1.9.1 R2 đã có trong code nhưng config chưa):
```yaml
review:
  fix_routing:
    inline_threshold_loc: 20
    spawn_threshold_loc: 150
    escalate_threshold_loc: 500
    escalate_on_contract_change: true
    escalate_on_critical_domain: true
    max_iterations: 3
```

### Cost impact

Scope cost tăng ~20x (Haiku → Opus cho answer-challenger) + ~$0.03/round cho dimension-expander.
Estimated: $0.15-0.30/phase scope (vs $0.01 trước). Acceptable vì scope là decision-critical step.
Override: user set `adversarial_model: "haiku"` hoặc `adversarial_check: false` để về cost cũ.

### Files

- **MODIFIED** `_shared/lib/answer-challenger.sh` — default model + 8-lens prompt + 4 new issue_kind
- **NEW** `_shared/lib/dimension-expander.sh` (~350 LOC) — per-round gap-finding subagent protocol
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/scope.md` — dimension-expander hook in `<process>` header + per-round narration
- **MODIFIED** `vg.config.template.md` — scope section rewrite + review section NEW

### Migration

Auto via `/vg:update` (3-way merge). User keeping custom `adversarial_model: "haiku"` sẽ stay (config preservation).
Fresh install gets Opus default. `dimension_expand_check: true` enabled by default — set `false` to disable completely.

## [1.9.2.6] - 2026-04-18

### 2 bugs dò được qua 9 smoke tests — shipped

**Bug #1: unreachable-triage extraction missed in v1.9.0 T3**

v1.9.0 T3 extracted bash from 4 shared libs (artifact-manifest, telemetry, override-debt, foundation-drift) to `lib/*.sh` NHƯNG MISSED `unreachable-triage.md`. `review.md:2948` calls `triage_unreachable_goals()` WITHOUT source statement → function undefined → silent skip → UNREACHABLE goals never classified → `/vg:accept` hard-gate can't enforce `bug-this-phase` / `cross-phase-pending`.

Fix: NEW `_shared/lib/unreachable-triage.sh` (~362 LOC) with both functions (`triage_unreachable_goals` + `unreachable_triage_accept_gate`). Patched `review.md` step `unreachable_triage` to source + invoke.

**Bug #2: v1.9.x config drift undetected**

v1.9.0-v1.9.2 added 6 new config sections (`review.fix_routing`, `phase_profiles`, `test_strategy`, `scope`, `models.review_fix_inline`, `models.review_fix_spawn`) nhưng workflow không check user config có những sections này chưa. Projects update v1.9.x via `/vg:update` nhận .sh/.md mới nhưng `vg.config.md` vẫn ở schema cũ → workflow fallback silent → features như 3-tier fix routing không hoạt động.

Fix: `config-loader.md` thêm schema drift detection — scan vg.config.md cho 6 sections v1.9.x. Missing → WARN với tên section + purpose + impact + fix command (`/vg:init` hoặc manual add từ template).

### Smoke test results (9 areas tested)

| Area | Verdict |
|------|---------|
| Phase 0 session + profile | ✅ |
| Phase 1 code scan | ✅ |
| Phase 3 fix routing config | ⚠️ drift detected → fix #2 |
| Phase 4b code_exists fallback | ✅ |
| unreachable_triage helper | 🐛 extraction missed → fix #1 |
| Block resolver L2 architect fd3 | ✅ pattern OK |
| vg-haiku-scanner skill | ✅ present |
| Playwright lock manager | ✅ claim+release clean |
| env-commands.md | ⚠️ documented convention (not bug) |

### Files

- **NEW** `_shared/lib/unreachable-triage.sh` (362 LOC, `bash -n` clean)
- **MODIFIED** `review.md` step `unreachable_triage` — source helper, graceful fallback
- **MODIFIED** `_shared/config-loader.md` — CONFIG DRIFT scan block emits WARN for each missing v1.9.x section

### Migration v1.9.2.5 → v1.9.2.6

- Review unreachable triage: transparent — was silent-skipping before, now runs real classification
- Config drift: warns on next command. User runs `/vg:init` to regenerate OR manually adds sections from `vg.config.template.md`. No block — fallback safe.

## [1.9.2.5] - 2026-04-18

### probe_api substring match — eliminate false BLOCKED

**Bug discovered live running review 7.12 Phase 4d with v1.9.2.4 matrix:**

Phase 7.12 GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX showed 15 BLOCKED for API goals. Spot check G-02:

```
G-02 BLOCKED | no_handler_for:POST /conversion-goals
```

But the handler EXISTS:
```
apps/api/src/modules/conversion/conversion.plugin.ts:21:
  await fastify.register(conversionRoutes(service), { prefix: '/api/v1/conversion-goals' })
```

Root cause: probe_api extracted `tail -1` path fragment → `/conversion-goals`. Then grepped `['"\\`]/conversion-goals['"\\`]` — required fragment as standalone quoted string. But code has `'/api/v1/conversion-goals'` — fragment in middle of longer literal → no match → false BLOCKED.

### Fix — 2-tier fragment + substring match

Try full path first, then last segment as fallback. Grep pattern allows substring within quoted literal: `['"\\`][^'"\\`]*${frag}[^'"\\`]*['"\\`]`

### Phase 7.12 live result (v1.9.2.4 → v1.9.2.5)

| Metric | v1.9.2.4 | v1.9.2.5 |
|--------|----------|----------|
| READY | 10 | **24** |
| BLOCKED | 15 | **1** |
| NOT_SCANNED | 14 | 14 |

14 previously-false BLOCKED → correctly READY with evidence. Only 1 genuine BLOCKED remains. 14 NOT_SCANNED = 6 UI goals (need browser) + 8 probe-unparseable criteria.

Priority pass %:
- critical: 8/12 (66.7%) — need browser for 4 UI goals
- important: 14/20 (70%) — need browser for 2 UI + fix 4 probe-unparseable
- nice-to-have: 2/7 (28.6%) — mostly UI + unparseable

### Migration v1.9.2.4 → v1.9.2.5

Transparent. Re-run `/vg:review` on phases with previous false BLOCKED → now mostly READY.

## [1.9.2.4] - 2026-04-18

### Phase 4b/4d matrix merger runnable

**Gap discovered post-v1.9.2.3:** v1.9.2.3 added surface probe execution in Phase 4a (writes `.surface-probe-results.json`). But Phase 4b/4d "integration" was prose-only — no runnable bash to merge RUNTIME-MAP.goal_sequences + probe-results → unified GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md.

Result: even after probes ran, backend goals fell back to NOT_SCANNED because matrix generation was pseudo-code template.

### Fix — `_shared/lib/matrix-merger.sh` (new ~150 LOC)

`merge_and_write_matrix(phase_dir, test_goals, runtime_map, probe_results, output_md)`:

**Merge precedence:**
- UI goals (surface=ui/ui-mobile) → RUNTIME-MAP.goal_sequences[gid].result → READY/BLOCKED/FAILED/NOT_SCANNED
- Backend goals (api/data/integration/time-driven) → probe_results[gid].status → READY/BLOCKED/INFRA_PENDING/SKIPPED (SKIPPED maps to NOT_SCANNED)

**Output:** canonical GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md with:
1. Summary (all 6 statuses counted)
2. By Priority table (critical=100%/important=80%/nice-to-have=50% thresholds + pass % + gate verdict per priority)
3. Goal Details table (each goal with surface + status + evidence)
4. Gate verdict (✅ PASS / ⛔ BLOCK / ⚠️ INTERMEDIATE) with next-action hints

**Verdict logic:** Intermediate (NOT_SCANNED+FAILED>0) → INTERMEDIATE; else any priority under threshold → BLOCK; else PASS.

### Phase 7.12 live result (after v1.9.2.4)

```
VERDICT=INTERMEDIATE
TOTAL=39
READY=10
BLOCKED=15
NOT_SCANNED=14 (6 UI no browser + 8 probe SKIPPED)
```

Priority breakdown:
- critical: 2/12 ready (16.7%) ⛔
- important: 7/20 ready (35.0%) ⛔
- nice-to-have: 1/7 ready (14.3%) ⛔

Each goal row has concrete evidence: `handler=apps/pixel/src/routes/event.route.ts/event`, `migration=infra/clickhouse/migrations/007_conversion_events.sql|table=conversion_events`, etc. No more "??? reason unknown" — users can act on each BLOCKED.

### review.md patch

Phase 4d section replaces prose template with `merge_and_write_matrix` invocation. Exports `$VERDICT $READY $BLOCKED $NOT_SCANNED $INTERMEDIATE` env vars for 4c-pre gate + write-artifacts step.

### Bug fixed during implementation

Priority regex `(\w+)` stopped at dash → "nice-to-have" captured as "nice" → by-priority table showed 0 nice-to-have. Fixed to `(\w[\w-]*)`.

### Migration v1.9.2.3 → v1.9.2.4

Transparent. Review now writes real matrix with real evidence instead of pseudo-template. Legacy phases re-run review to regenerate.

## [1.9.2.3] - 2026-04-17

### Mixed-phase surface probes — fix NOT_SCANNED black hole for backend goals

**Bug discovered running `/vg:review 7.12` post-v1.9.2.2:**

v1.9.1 R1 shipped surface classification (26 api + 6 data + 6 ui + 1 integration goals tagged correctly). v1.9.2 shipped phase profile system. BUT for **mixed phase** (UI + backend goals cùng tồn tại), only pure-backend fast-path (UI_GOAL_COUNT==0) được implement thực sự. Surface probes cho `api/data/integration/time-driven` trong mixed phase chỉ có pseudo-code docs — KHÔNG có bash thực.

**Hệ quả 7.12**:
- 6 UI goals → browser scan cover được
- 33 backend goals → KHÔNG có sequence → rơi vào "NOT_SCANNED" branch
- 4c-pre gate BLOCK với 33 intermediate goals → block_resolve L2 architect
- User bị đẩy vào loop 33 goals "cần resolve trước exit"

### Fix — `_shared/lib/surface-probe.sh` (new ~250 LOC helper)

**4 probe functions**:
- `probe_api(gid, block)` — extract HTTP method + path, grep handler trong `apps/*/src/**` → READY hoặc BLOCKED
- `probe_data(gid, block)` — extract table/collection name (3 strategies: backtick, SQL keyword, bare snake_case fallback) + grep migrations + check `infra_deps` → READY/BLOCKED/INFRA_PENDING
- `probe_integration(gid, block, phase_dir)` — check fixture file OR grep keyword (postback/webhook/kafka/etc) trong source
- `probe_time_driven(gid, block)` — grep cron/setInterval/BullQueue/Agenda registration

**Dispatcher** `run_surface_probe(gid, surface, phase_dir, test_goals_file)` — routes per surface, normalizes CRLF (Windows git-bash bug fix), returns `STATUS|EVIDENCE`.

### Review.md patch

Phase 4a được mở rộng với **"Mixed-phase surface probe execution"** section — chạy probes cho mọi goal surface ≠ ui, ghi `.surface-probe-results.json`. Phase 4b integration: check probe result TRƯỚC khi rơi vào NOT_SCANNED branch.

### Phase 7.12 dry-run results

```
33 backend goals probed:
  READY:         10  ← handler/migration/caller found
  BLOCKED:       15  ← pattern mismatch or missing
  INFRA_PENDING:  0
  SKIPPED:        8  ← can't parse endpoint/table from criteria
```

10 READY > 0 NOT_SCANNED (previous behavior) — probes actually execute. 15 BLOCKED là false-positives do heuristic endpoint extraction chưa handle subdomain paths (`pixel.vollx.com/event`) — future iteration improves.

### Bugs fixed during implementation

1. `awk` reserved word `in` conflict → renamed variable `inside`
2. Windows CRLF (`\r`) from `python -c` output → `tr -d '\r'` normalization in `run_surface_probe`
3. Table identifier extraction too narrow (backtick-only) → 3-tier fallback (backtick → SQL keyword → bare snake_case)

### Known limitations

- Endpoint pattern extraction simple (regex on criteria text) — 15/33 BLOCKED là tune-able
- Config-driven paths hardcoded hiện tại (`apps/api/src`, etc.) — next iteration will read from `config.code_patterns.backend_src`

### Migration v1.9.2.2 → v1.9.2.3

Transparent. Review trên mixed phase tự động chạy probes thay vì mark NOT_SCANNED. Không cần user action.

## [1.9.2.2] - 2026-04-17

### Hotfix — Phase directory lookup with zero-padding

**Bug discovered live while running `/vg:review 7.12`:**

User typed `7.12`. Phase directory is `.planning/phases/07.12-conversion-tracking-pixel/` (zero-padded). Naive glob `ls -d .planning/phases/${PHASE_NUMBER}*` = `ls -d .planning/phases/7.12*` → no match → PHASE_DIR empty → entire review pipeline silent-fails with cryptic generic errors (no "phase not found" message).

Confirmed in 3 runnable sites:
- `review.md:107`
- `test.md:92`
- `build.md:90`

### Fix — `_shared/lib/phase-resolver.sh` (new helper)

`resolve_phase_dir PHASE_NUMBER` — returns directory path, handles:

1. **Exact match with dash suffix**: `07.12-*` (prevents matching sub-phases like `07.12.1-*`)
2. **Zero-pad integer part**: `7.12` → `07.12-*` (fixes the reported bug)
3. **Fallback boundary-aware prefix**: only `-` or `.` as boundary (prevents `99` matching `999.1-*`)
4. **Clear error on miss**: lists available phases + tips

**Verification**:
```
resolve_phase_dir 7.12     → .planning/phases/07.12-conversion-tracking-pixel/  ✓
resolve_phase_dir 07.12    → .planning/phases/07.12-conversion-tracking-pixel/  ✓
resolve_phase_dir 07.12.1  → .planning/phases/07.12.1-pixel-infra-provisioning/ ✓
resolve_phase_dir 99       → stderr error + list, rc=1  ✓
```

### Patched commands

- `commands/vg/review.md` step `00_session_lifecycle`
- `commands/vg/test.md` step `00_session_lifecycle`
- `commands/vg/build.md` step `00_session_lifecycle`

All 3 now source `phase-resolver.sh` and call `resolve_phase_dir`. Fallback to old logic if helper missing (backward-compat).

### Migration v1.9.2.1 → v1.9.2.2

No user action needed. Transparent fix. Users typing phase numbers without zero-padding (`7.12`, `5.3`) will now correctly resolve to padded directories.

### Known limitation

Other 7 files that reference `${PHASE_NUMBER}*` pattern (specs.md, project.md, migrate.md, session-lifecycle.md, vg-executor-rules.md, visual-regression.md, architect-prompt-template.md) — not runnable code, just documentation examples. No fix needed.

## [1.9.2.1] - 2026-04-17

### Hotfix — `feature-legacy` profile for phases without SPECS.md

**Bug discovered while testing `/vg:review 7.12` post-v1.9.2 ship:**

Phase 7.12 (conversion-tracking-pixel) was built before VG required SPECS.md as part of the feature pipeline. It has:
- ✅ PLAN.md, CONTEXT.md, API-CONTRACTS.md, TEST-GOALS.md (39 goals), SUMMARY.md
- ✅ RUNTIME-MAP.json, GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md (from prior review)
- ❌ SPECS.md (convention not enforced at phase creation time)

**v1.9.2 behavior:** `detect_phase_profile` rule 1 returned `"unknown"` when SPECS.md missing → `required_artifacts` = only `SPECS.md` → review BLOCKED at prerequisite gate. Block_resolver L2 architect would propose "run `/vg:specs` first" — which is wrong for a phase already built past specs stage.

### Fix — Rule 1b: legacy feature fallback

`detect_phase_profile` now returns `"feature-legacy"` when:
- SPECS.md is missing **AND**
- PLAN.md + TEST-GOALS.md + API-CONTRACTS.md all present

Profile table additions:
- `feature-legacy`:
  - `required_artifacts` = `CONTEXT.md PLAN.md API-CONTRACTS.md TEST-GOALS.md SUMMARY.md` (no SPECS)
  - `skip_artifacts` = `SPECS.md`
  - `review_mode` = `full` (same as feature)
  - `test_mode` = `full`
  - `goal_coverage` = `TEST-GOALS`
- Narration (Vietnamese): "Pha feature legacy... bỏ qua SPECS. Khuyến nghị: tạo SPECS.md retrospective cho audit trail."

### Files

- `_shared/lib/phase-profile.sh` — +8 LOC Rule 1b detection + 2 new case branches in `phase_profile_required_artifacts`, `phase_profile_skip_artifacts`, `phase_profile_review_mode`, `phase_profile_test_mode`, `phase_profile_goal_coverage_source`, plus narration block.

### Verification

- Phase 7.12 (no SPECS, full artifacts): v1.9.2 → `unknown` BLOCK ❌ → v1.9.2.1 → `feature-legacy` PASS ✅
- Phase 07.12.1 (infra hotfix with SPECS + success_criteria bash): `infra` (unchanged) ✅

### Migration v1.9.2 → v1.9.2.1

No user action needed. Pure detection fix — runs on every review, transparent upgrade.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-04-17

### Phase profile system + full block-resolver coverage + sync.sh fix

**User-flagged critical defect**: `/vg:review 07.12.1` (pixel-infra-provisioning — hotfix phase with SPECS success_criteria bash checklist, NO TEST-GOALS) blocked with "BLOCK — prerequisites missing" then fell back to the BANNED anti-pattern "list 3 options A/B/C, stop, wait". 2 root causes:

1. **VG workflow assumed every phase = feature** (needs TEST-GOALS + API-CONTRACTS + full pipeline). Reality: strategic apps have phase types (infra, hotfix, bugfix, migration, docs).
2. **v1.9.1 block_resolve coverage was partial** — only 4 flagship sites, 8+ secondary sites fell back to anti-pattern.

### Added — P5 Phase Profile System

- **NEW** `_shared/lib/phase-profile.sh` (354 LOC, 9 exported functions):
  - `detect_phase_profile(phase_dir)` — 7 rules, stops first match, idempotent pure function
  - `phase_profile_required_artifacts` / `_skip_artifacts` / `_review_mode` / `_test_mode` / `_goal_coverage_source` — static profile tables
  - `parse_success_criteria(specs_path)` — Python JSON array from SPECS `## Success criteria` checklist
  - `phase_profile_summarize` — Vietnamese narration on stderr
  - `phase_profile_check_required` — gate helper

- **6 phase profiles** with distinct artifact requirements + review/test modes:
  - **feature** (default) — full pipeline: SPECS → scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept
  - **infra** — SPECS success_criteria bash checklist, NO TEST-GOALS/API-CONTRACTS/CONTEXT. review_mode=`infra-smoke` (parse bash → run → READY/FAILED → implicit goals S-01..S-NN)
  - **hotfix** — parent_phase field, small patch, inherits parent goals. ≥3 infra bash cmds promoted to `infra`
  - **bugfix** — issue_id/bug_ref field, regression-focused
  - **migration** — migration keyword + touches schema paths, rollback plan required
  - **docs** — markdown-only file changes

- **`vg.config.md.phase_profiles`** schema (template + project config) — `required_artifacts`, `skip_artifacts`, `review_mode`, `test_mode`, `goal_coverage` per profile

### Added — P4 Block Resolver Full Coverage

**12 block_resolve sites across 5 files** (8 new + 4 pre-existing from v1.9.1):
- `review.md` × 4: prereq-missing (NEW), infra-smoke-not-ready (NEW), infra-unavailable (Scenario F patched), not-scanned-defer
- `test.md` × 3: flow-spec-missing (patched), dynamic-ids (patched), goal-test-binding
- `build.md` × 2: design-missing (patched), test-unit-missing (patched)
- `accept.md` × 2: regression (patched), unreachable (patched)
- `blueprint.md` × 1: no-context (NEW profile-aware)

**Banned anti-pattern eliminated**: no more "list 3 options, stop, wait" without L1 inline / L2 architect Haiku / L3 user choice attempt.

### Fixed — sync.sh missed _shared/lib/ and lib/test-runners/

- v1.9.0–v1.9.1 sync.sh didn't include `*.sh` files under `_shared/lib/` → distributed vgflow tarballs were missing 18 runtime functions → `/vg:doctor` + test runners silently degraded on fresh installs.
- v1.9.2 adds 3 sync_dir calls: `lib/*.sh`, `lib/*.md`, `lib/test-runners/*.sh`.

### Changed

- **`review.md`** — Step 0 profile detection gates ALL subsequent checks. Infra phase: skip browser discover, parse SPECS success_criteria, run each → map implicit goals S-01..S-NN, generate GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md, PASS without TEST-GOALS.
- **`blueprint.md`** — Profile detection + `skip_artifacts` check → don't generate TEST-GOALS/API-CONTRACTS for infra/docs phases.
- **`scope.md`** — Profile short-circuit for non-feature (infra/hotfix/bugfix/docs skip 5-round discussion, only feature phases need it).
- **`test.md`** — Profile-aware test_mode routing (`infra-smoke` re-runs SPECS bash on sandbox).

### Phase 07.12.1 integration test (dry-run verified)

1. `detect_phase_profile` → `infra` (≥3 infra bash cmds in success_criteria + no TEST-GOALS)
2. `required_artifacts` = [SPECS.md, PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md] — SUMMARY.md missing → block_resolve L2 architect proposal (NOT 3-option stall)
3. `parse_success_criteria` → 6 implicit goals S-01..S-06
4. `review_mode` = `infra-smoke` → browser/TEST-GOALS skipped, bash commands executed, GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md written

### Backward compatibility

- Phases without detectable profile → default to `feature` (v1.9.1 behavior)
- Phases with `feature` profile → unchanged pipeline
- No migration required — profile detection is read-only + lazy

### Migration v1.9.1 → v1.9.2

**No required actions.** All changes are additive + profile-aware branches.

- Legacy phases auto-detect via SPECS structure → most become `feature`, select few become `infra`/`hotfix`/`bugfix` based on SPECS content.
- Example: phase 07.12.1 → `infra` (has SPECS success_criteria + no TEST-GOALS + parent_phase field).
- Example: phase 07.12 → `feature` (full pipeline artifacts).

### Deferred to v1.9.3

- **R3.2 dimension-expander** — scope adversarial proactive expansion of dimensions (orthogonal to v1.9.1 R3 answer challenger). Ship as enhancement, not critical for 07.12.1 fix.
- **Codex-skills update** — sync structure via sync.sh (new lib sync added), codex-skills prose still v1.9.1 baseline. Update to v1.9.2 behavior (profile routing) in v1.9.3 batch.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-04-17

### Surface-driven testing — VG handle được mọi loại phase (UI / API / data / time-driven / integration / mobile / custom)

User feedback từ phase 7.12 conversion tracking (backend, không UI): workflow hiện tại UI-centric — review browser-discover, test Playwright. Backend phase deadlock: review block goals NOT_SCANNED forever, no UI to discover. Đề xuất 3 options đều "bàn lùi" việc test. **Đây là defect, không phải feature**.

v1.9.1 ship 4 nguyên tắc thành workflow rules — generic, no project hardcode:

### Added — R1: Surface-driven test taxonomy

- **NEW** `_shared/lib/goal-classifier.sh` (355 LOC) — multi-source classifier (TEST-GOALS text + CONTEXT D-XX + API-CONTRACTS + SUMMARY + RUNTIME-MAP + code grep). Confidence ≥0.80 auto-classify, 0.50-0.80 spawn Haiku tie-break, <0.50 AskUserQuestion. Lazy migration via `schema_version: "1.9.1"` frontmatter stamp. Idempotent.
- **NEW** `_shared/lib/test-runners/dispatch.sh` (59 LOC) + 6 surface runners (~80 LOC each):
  - `ui-playwright.sh` — wraps existing browser test infra
  - `ui-mobile-maestro.sh` — wraps mobile-deploy.md infra
  - `api-curl.sh` — bash + curl + jq pattern
  - `data-dbquery.sh` — bash + DB client lookup (psql/sqlite3/clickhouse-client/mongosh) per `vg.config.md`
  - `time-faketime.sh` — bash + faketime + invoke + assert
  - `integration-mock.sh` — spin mock receiver (HTTP server random port), assert request received
- **NEW** `vg.config.md.test_strategy` schema — 5 default surfaces với `runner` + `detect_keywords`. Project tự extend (rtb-engine, ml-model, blockchain, etc.). VG core không biết RTB là gì.
- **PATCH** `blueprint.md` — call classify_goals_if_needed sau TEST-GOALS write
- **PATCH** `review.md` — step 4a: classify + per-surface routing. **Pure-backend phase (zero ui goals) → skip browser discover entirely** (fixes 7.12 deadlock)
- **PATCH** `test.md` — step 5c: classify + dispatch_test_runner per goal surface. Results merge vào TEST-RESULTS.md
- **Phase 7.12 dry-run**: 17/39 goals auto-classify, 22 vào Haiku tie-break — confirms backend classification works

### Added — R2+R4: Block resolver 4-level (agency)

User feedback: "review/test khi block toàn list 3 options A/B/C dừng chờ. AI biết hướng nhưng vẫn dừng. Phải tự nghĩ → quyết → làm; chỉ stop khi thực sự không biết rẽ."

- **NEW** `_shared/lib/block-resolver.sh` (344 LOC) — 4 levels:
  - **L1 inline auto-fix** — try fix candidates, score, rationalization-guard check. Confidence ≥0.7 + guard PASS → ACT. Telemetry `block_self_resolved_inline`
  - **L2 architect Haiku** — spawn Haiku subagent với FULL phase context (SPECS+CONTEXT+PLAN+TEST-GOALS+SUMMARY+API-CONTRACTS+RUNTIME-MAP+code+infra). Returns structured proposal `{type: sub-phase|refactor|new-artifact|config-change, summary, file_structure, framework_choice, decision_questions, confidence}`. Telemetry `block_architect_proposed`
  - **L3 user choice** — AskUserQuestion present proposal với recommendation. Telemetry `block_user_chose_proposal`
  - **L4 stuck escalate** — only after L1+L2+L3 exhausted. Telemetry `block_truly_stuck`
- **NEW** `_shared/lib/architect-prompt-template.md` (~110 lines) — reusable Haiku prompt
- **PATCH** flagship gate sites in review/test/build/accept (4 sites). 8 secondary sites noted for future sweep (same template).
- **Banned anti-pattern**: "list 3 options stop wait" without trying any. Every block MUST attempt L1 → L2 → L3 → L4.
- **Example trace (phase 7.12 review block)**:
  ```
  L1 retry-failed-scan → confidence 0.5 < 0.7 → skip
  L2 Haiku architect → proposal: {type: sub-phase, summary: "Create 07.12.2 Test Harness", file_structure: "apps/api/test/e2e/{fixtures,helpers,specs}", framework_choice: "vitest + supertest", confidence: 0.82}
  L3 AskUserQuestion → user accepts → emit telemetry → continue
  ```

### Added — R3: Scope adversarial answer challenger

User feedback: "Trong /vg:scope, mỗi câu trả lời của user, AI nên tự phản biện xem có vấn đề gì không. Nếu có thì hỏi tiếp."

- **NEW** `_shared/lib/answer-challenger.sh` (205 LOC) — sau mỗi user answer trong scope/project round:
  - Spawn Haiku subagent (zero parent context) với 4 lenses:
    1. Mâu thuẫn với D-XX/F-XX prior?
    2. Hidden assumption?
    3. Edge case missed (failure / scale / concurrency / timezone / unicode / multi-tenancy)?
    4. FOUNDATION conflict (platform / compliance / scale)?
  - Returns `{has_issue, issue_kind, evidence, follow_up_question, proposed_alternative}`
  - If issue → AskUserQuestion 3 options: Address (rephrase) / Acknowledge (accept tradeoff) / Defer (track in CONTEXT.md "Open questions")
- **PATCH** `scope.md` 5-round loop + `project.md` 7-round adaptive discussion
- **Loop guard**: max 3 challenges per phase; trivial answers (Y/N, ≤3 chars) skip; config `scope.adversarial_check: true` (default)
- **Telemetry event** `scope_answer_challenged` với `{round_id, issue_kind, user_chose}`

### Changed

- **`vg.config.md`** — new sections:
  - `test_strategy:` — surface taxonomy với detect_keywords + runners (R1)
  - `scope:` — `adversarial_check`, `adversarial_model`, `adversarial_max_rounds`, `adversarial_skip_trivial` (R3)
- **`telemetry.md`** — registered events: `goals_classified`, `block_self_resolved_inline`, `block_architect_proposed`, `block_user_chose_proposal`, `block_truly_stuck`, `scope_answer_challenged`

### v1.9.1 vs Round 2 score targets (expected)

Round 2 baseline: overall 6.75, robustness 7.0, consistency 6.0, onboarding 3.25 (flat).

Expected v1.9.1 movement:
- **Strategic fit ↑↑** — workflow handle được mọi loại phase (không còn UI-centric defect)
- **Robustness ↑** — block resolver 4-level removes "list 3 options stop" anti-pattern
- **Consistency ↑** — surface taxonomy makes review/test routing deterministic
- **Onboarding ↑** — backend phase no longer requires user workaround (tag tricks)

### Migration v1.9.0 → v1.9.1

**No required actions** — all changes additive + lazy migration.

- Phase cũ (e.g., 7.12) lần đầu chạy `/vg:review` → goal-classifier auto-classify từ artifacts → stamp `schema_version: "1.9.1"` → continue. Không cần command migration riêng.
- Phase mới: `/vg:blueprint` tự classify khi sinh TEST-GOALS lần đầu.
- Block resolver 4-level transparent — gates vẫn trigger như cũ, chỉ thêm L1/L2/L3 trước khi L4 escalate.
- Scope answer challenger: enabled by default; disable nếu prototype nhanh: `scope.adversarial_check: false` trong vg.config.md.

### Cross-AI evaluation context

v1.9.1 addresses user-flagged workflow defect not captured in Round 2 SYNTHESIS (UI-centricity assumption).
- Strategic application can have arbitrary phase types — workflow must NOT assume UI default.
- Block agency: AI must think → decide → act, not list options and stop.
- Adversarial scope: AI must challenge own assumptions during design, not record passively.

Tier B remaining (wave checkpoints, /vg:amend propagation, telemetry sqlite, foundation BLOCK, gate-manifest signing) deferred to v1.9.2+.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-17

### Tier A discipline batch — closing v1.8.0 residual gaps

Cross-AI Round 2 evaluation (codex/gemini/claude/opus) verdict CONCERNS — overall **6.75** (+1.0 vs v1.7.1), robustness **+2.25**, consistency **+1.5**, but onboarding flat **3.25/10** and AI-failure surface GREW (more gates × same self-rationalizing executor). v1.9.0 ships 5 discipline-focused fixes (T1–T5) consensus-flagged at Tier A.

### Added

- **T1. Rationalization-guard Haiku subagent** — `_shared/rationalization-guard.md` (REWRITTEN 61 → 235 LOC)
  - Replaces same-model self-check (CRITICAL Round 2 finding 4/4 consensus)
  - `rationalization_guard_check(gate_id, gate_spec, skip_reason)` spawns isolated Haiku subagent via Task tool with **zero parent context**
  - Returns PASS / FLAG / ESCALATE — caller acts: PASS continue, FLAG log critical debt, ESCALATE block + AskUserQuestion
  - Fail-closed: if subagent unavailable → ESCALATE (safe default)
  - Integrated at 8 gate-skip sites: `build.md` × 3 (wave-commits, design-check, build-hard-gate), `review.md` × 1 (NOT_SCANNED defer), `test.md` × 1 (dynamic-ids), `accept.md` × 2 (unreachable-triage, override-resolution-gate)
  - Telemetry event: `rationalization_guard_check` (subagent_model, verdict, confidence)
  - Deprecated alias `rationalization_guard()` retained with WARN

- **T2. `/vg:override-resolve --wont-fix` command** — `commands/vg/override-resolve.md` NEW (132 LOC)
  - Unblocks intentional permanent overrides at `/vg:accept` (claude CRITICAL finding)
  - Args: `<DEBT-ID> --reason='...' [--wont-fix]`
  - `--wont-fix` requires AskUserQuestion confirmation (audit safety)
  - Emits `override_resolved` telemetry event with `status=WONT_FIX`, `manual=true`, `reason=...`
  - `accept.md` step 3c filters WONT_FIX entries from blocking check

- **T2 (extension). Override status WONT_FIX** — `_shared/override-debt.md`
  - `override_resolve()` accepts optional `status` arg (RESOLVED|WONT_FIX, default RESOLVED)
  - New helper `override_resolve_by_id(debt_id, status, reason)` — patches single row, merges audit trail
  - `override_list_unresolved()` excludes WONT_FIX from blocking accept

- **T3. Bash extraction `_shared/*.md` → `_shared/lib/*.sh`** — NEW `_shared/lib/` directory
  - Fixes CRITICAL bug (claude+opus): `/vg:doctor` was `source .md` files which silently failed (YAML frontmatter `---` = bash syntax error). Functions undefined → false confidence
  - Created 4 .sh files (all `bash -n` syntax-clean):
    - `lib/artifact-manifest.sh` (185 LOC) — 3 functions
    - `lib/telemetry.sh` (206 LOC) — 8 functions
    - `lib/override-debt.sh` (242 LOC) — 5 functions
    - `lib/foundation-drift.sh` (436 LOC) — 4 functions
  - 18 functions extracted total
  - Markdown stays as docs with "Runtime note" callout pointing to .sh
  - Patched call sites: `doctor.md`, `accept.md` step 3c, `_shared/foundation-drift.md` examples

- **T5 (extension). `_shared/lib/namespace-validator.sh`** — NEW (105 LOC)
  - `validate_d_xx_namespace(file_path, scope_kind)` — scope_kind ∈ {"foundation"|"phase:N"}
  - `validate_d_xx_namespace_stdin(scope_kind)` — pipeline-friendly variant
  - Tolerates D-XX inside fenced code, blockquotes, inline backticks (false-positive guard)

### Changed

- **T4. `/vg:doctor` split into 4 focused commands** (Round 2 4/4 consensus: god-command anti-pattern)
  - **NEW** `commands/vg/health.md` (315 LOC) — full project health + per-phase deep inspect (was doctor "full" + "phase" modes)
  - **NEW** `commands/vg/integrity.md` (194 LOC) — manifest validation across all phases (was doctor `--integrity`)
  - **NEW** `commands/vg/gate-stats.md` (179 LOC) — telemetry query API (was doctor `--gates`)
  - **NEW** `commands/vg/recover.md` (272 LOC) — guided recovery for stuck phases (was doctor `--recover`)
  - **REWRITTEN** `commands/vg/doctor.md` (673 → 115 LOC) — thin dispatcher routing to 4 sub-commands
  - Total 1075 LOC across 5 files (was 673 mono) — 60% increase justified by clearer modularity + unambiguous argument grammar
  - Backward compat: legacy `--integrity`, `--gates`, `--recover` flags still work with WARN deprecation

- **T5. Telemetry write-strict / read-tolerant** — `_shared/lib/telemetry.sh` + `_shared/telemetry.md`
  - **READ tolerant:** legacy 4-arg `emit_telemetry()` call still accepted (back-compat shim)
  - **WRITE strict:** shim now logs WARN to stderr with caller stack hint, marks event with `legacy_call:true` payload
  - `telemetry_step_start()` / `telemetry_step_end()` updated to call `emit_telemetry_v2()` directly (was using shim — gate_id was empty in majority events)
  - Integration pattern examples in telemetry.md updated to use `emit_telemetry_v2`
  - Added config `telemetry.strict_write: true` (default v1.9.0); v2.0 will hard-fail
  - Bash bug fix: `${4:-{}}` parsing was appending stray `}`

- **T5. D-XX namespace write-strict** — `scope.md`, `project.md`, `_shared/vg-executor-rules.md`
  - **READ tolerant:** legacy bare D-XX accepted in old files (commit-msg hook WARN, not BLOCK)
  - **WRITE strict:** `scope.md` blocks `CONTEXT.md.staged` write if generated text contains bare D-XX outside fenced code → forces `P{phase}.D-XX`
  - Same gate in `project.md` for `FOUNDATION.md.staged` → forces `F-XX`
  - Validator tolerates fenced code/blockquotes/inline backticks (no false positives)

### v1.9.0 vs Round 2 score targets

Round 2 baseline: overall 6.75, robustness 7.0, consistency 6.0, onboarding **3.25** (flat).

Expected v1.9.0 movement:
- **AI failure surface ↓** — rationalization-guard now Haiku-isolated, can't be self-rationalized
- **Onboarding ↑** — `/vg:doctor` 5-mode god command split into 4 focused commands with clear verbs
- **Consistency ↑** — telemetry write-strict ensures gate_id populated; D-XX namespace enforced at write-time
- **Robustness ↑** — `.sh` extraction fixes silent function-loading failure that made T2 (Round 1) theater

### Migration v1.8.0 → v1.9.0

**Required actions:**

1. **Backup** (always): `git commit -am "pre-v1.9.0"`
2. **No data migration needed** — all changes additive or back-compat
3. **Sub-command discovery**: `/vg:health`, `/vg:integrity`, `/vg:gate-stats`, `/vg:recover` are new top-level commands. Use them directly. `/vg:doctor` still works as dispatcher.
4. **Override --wont-fix**: any pre-existing override entries marked OPEN can now be resolved manually via `/vg:override-resolve <DEBT-ID> --wont-fix --reason='...'`
5. **Telemetry**: any custom code calling `emit_telemetry()` 4-arg signature will see WARN in stderr — migrate to `emit_telemetry_v2(event_type, phase, step, gate_id, outcome, payload, correlation_id, command)`. Old code keeps working through v1.10.0.
6. **D-XX**: continue to accept legacy bare D-XX on read; new `/vg:scope` and `/vg:project` runs will refuse to WRITE bare D-XX. Use `migrate-d-xx-namespace.py --apply` (v1.8.0+) if not done.

**No breaking changes** — all v1.8.0 code paths continue to work; new gates are additive.

### Cross-AI evaluation context

v1.9.0 addresses Tier A from `.planning/vg-eval/SYNTHESIS-r2.md`:
- C1 Rationalization-guard deferral (4/4 consensus) → T1
- M1 /vg:doctor god-command (4/4) → T4
- M3 Backward-compat windows AI rationalization (4/4) → T5 (write-strict)
- M4 Override --wont-fix missing (claude critical) → T2
- M8 /vg:doctor source-chain bug (claude+opus) → T3

Tier B (wave checkpoints, /vg:amend propagation, telemetry sqlite, foundation BLOCK, gate-manifest signing) deferred to v1.9.x. Tier C deferred to v2.0.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-17

### Tier 2 fixes batch — closing AI corner-cutting surface

Sau cross-AI evaluation 4 reviewers (codex, gemini, claude, opus) — verdict CONCERNS với onboarding 3.25/10, consistency/robustness 4.5–4.75/10. v1.8.0 ship 8 cải tiến (T1–T8) đóng các lỗ hổng "soft policy" và "observability theater" được consensus flag.

### Added

- **T1. Structured telemetry schema (v2)** — `_shared/telemetry.md`
  - `emit_telemetry_v2(event_type, phase, step, gate_id, outcome, payload, correlation_id, command)` với uuid `event_id`
  - `telemetry_query --gate-id=X --outcome=Y --since=Z` để root-cause analysis thực sự
  - `telemetry_warn_overrides` auto-WARN khi 1 gate bị OVERRIDE > N lần trong milestone
  - Event types mới: `override_resolved`, `artifact_written`, `artifact_read_validated`, `drift_detected`
  - Back-compat shim: `emit_telemetry()` cũ vẫn work, map sang v2

- **T2. `/vg:doctor` command** — `commands/vg/doctor.md` (NEW, 673 LOC)
  - 5 modes: bare (project health), `{phase}` (deep inspect), `--integrity` (hash validate), `--gates` (gate audit), `--recover {phase}` (6 corruption recovery flows)
  - Replaces "fix manually + grep telemetry.jsonl" pattern

- **T3. Artifact manifest với SHA256** — `_shared/artifact-manifest.md` (NEW)
  - `artifact_manifest_write(phase_dir, command, ...paths)` ghi `.artifact-manifest.json` LAST sau khi all artifacts complete
  - `artifact_manifest_validate(phase_dir)` → 0=valid, 1=missing, 2=corruption
  - `artifact_manifest_backfill(phase_dir, command)` migrate phase legacy
  - Chống multi-file atomicity gap (crash mid-write)

- **T8. `/vg:update` gate-integrity verify** — `scripts/vg_update.py`, `commands/vg/update.md`, `reapply-patches.md`
  - GitHub Action publish `gate-manifest.json` per release
  - `update.md` step `6b_verify_gate_integrity` so sánh hash gate blocks vs manifest
  - `/vg:reapply-patches --verify-gates` mode bắt buộc trước /vg:build sau update
  - Build/review/test/accept: early hard gate block nếu unverified gates

### Changed (BREAKING — migration required)

- **T4. D-XX namespace migration (MANDATORY)** — split namespace:
  - **F-XX** = FOUNDATION decisions (project-wide)
  - **P{phase}.D-XX** = per-phase decisions (e.g., `P7.6.D-12`)
  - Migration script: `scripts/migrate-d-xx-namespace.py` (450 LOC, idempotent, atomic backup)
    - `--dry-run` (default) → preview changes
    - `--apply` → commit + backup to `.planning/.archive/{ts}/pre-migration/`
    - Negative-lookbehind regex `(?<![\w.])D-(\d+)(?!\d)` (no false-positive)
  - **Backward compat window:** legacy `D-XX` accepted with WARN through v1.10.0; HARD-REJECT v1.10.1+
  - Files updated: `project.md`, `scope.md`, `blueprint.md`, `accept.md` (Section A.1 for F-XX), `vg-executor-rules.md`, `vg-planner-rules.md`, `templates/vg/commit-msg`

- **T5. Override expiry contract (BREAKING)** — `_shared/override-debt.md`, `accept.md`
  - **Time-based expiry BANNED** — overrides chỉ resolve khi gate bypassed RE-RUN clean
  - New field: `resolved_by_event_id` (telemetry event ID, kiểm chứng được)
  - New API: `override_resolve()`, `override_list_unresolved()`, `override_migrate_legacy()`
  - `/vg:accept` step `3c_override_resolution_gate` — block accept nếu override unresolved

### Improved

- **T6. Foundation semantic drift + notify-and-track** — `_shared/foundation-drift.md`, `.planning/.drift-register.md`
  - 8 structured claim families (mobile/desktop/serverless/PCI/GDPR/HIPAA/SOC2/high-QPS) thay regex on prose
  - 3 tiers: INFO (log), WARN (notify user + track register), BLOCK-deferred
  - **`.drift-register.md`** — dedup tracking, không quên drift đã flag
  - `drift_detected` telemetry event tự động emit

- **T7. `/vg:scope-review` incremental mode** — `commands/vg/scope-review.md` (385 → 665 LOC)
  - `.scope-review-baseline.json` — chỉ re-compare phases changed since baseline
  - `--full` flag để full O(n²) scan (default = incremental)
  - Delta summary + telemetry emit cho audit
  - Khử O(n²) scaling failure ở milestone 50+ phases

### Migration guide v1.7.1 → v1.8.0

**Required actions:**

1. **Backup**: `git commit -am "pre-v1.8.0"` hoặc `cp -r .planning .planning.bak`
2. **Run D-XX migration (dry-run first)**:
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/scripts/migrate-d-xx-namespace.py --dry-run
   # Review preview, sau đó:
   python3 .claude/scripts/migrate-d-xx-namespace.py --apply
   ```
3. **Backfill artifact manifests** (legacy phases):
   ```bash
   /vg:doctor --integrity   # detect missing manifests
   # For each phase: artifact_manifest_backfill called via /vg:doctor --recover
   ```
4. **Migrate legacy overrides** (loại bỏ time-based expiry):
   ```bash
   # /vg:accept tự gọi override_migrate_legacy() lần đầu
   ```
5. **Drift register init**: `.planning/.drift-register.md` tự tạo lần đầu chạy `/vg:scope-review` hoặc khi drift detected.

**Backward compatibility:**
- Legacy `D-XX` (không namespace) — WARN nhưng vẫn pass qua v1.10.0
- Legacy telemetry events thiếu `event_id` — `emit_telemetry()` shim auto-fill
- Phase artifacts chưa có manifest — `/vg:doctor --recover` backfill được

**Breaking only at v1.10.1+:**
- D-XX không namespace → HARD-REJECT
- Override không có `resolved_by_event_id` → HARD-REJECT

### Cross-AI evaluation context

v1.8.0 đáp ứng Tier 2 priorities từ `.planning/vg-eval/SYNTHESIS.md`:
- M4 (Observability theater) → T1 + T2
- M5 (`scope-review` O(n²)) → T7
- M6 (Foundation drift wording-only) → T6
- M7 (`/vg:update` gate-integrity) → T8
- M8 (D-XX namespace collision) → T4
- M9 (Override expiry undefined) → T5
- M10 (Multi-file atomicity gap) → T3

Tier 1 (wave checkpoints, command consolidation, rationalization-guard subagent, /vg:amend propagation, CrossAI domain disclaimer) — deferred sang v2.0 (breaking).

## [1.7.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added — Term glossary RULE (Vietnamese explanation for English terms)

User feedback: Khi narration tiếng Việt có nhiều thuật ngữ tiếng Anh (BLOCK, drift, foundation, legacy, MERGE NOT OVERWRITE...), user khó đoán nghĩa khi xem log/discussion/UAT artifact.

**RULE mới:** Mọi thuật ngữ tiếng Anh trong user-facing output PHẢI có giải thích VN trong dấu ngoặc đơn ở lần xuất hiện đầu tiên trong cùng message/section.

Ví dụ:
- ❌ Sai: `Goal G-05 status: BLOCKED — required dependency missing`
- ✅ Đúng: `Goal G-05 status: BLOCKED (bị chặn) — required dependency (phụ thuộc) missing`

### Files

- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/term-glossary.md` — RULE đầy đủ + 7 nhóm glossary (Pipeline state, Foundation states, Workflow, Tech, Test, Identifiers, Action verbs) với 100+ thuật ngữ phổ biến
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/review.md`, `test.md`, `build.md`, `project.md` — thêm rule #5 vào NARRATION_POLICY block tham chiếu term-glossary.md

### Scope

- ✅ Apply: narration, status messages, error messages, summary, log files, UAT.md, AskUserQuestion options/labels

### Subagent inheritance

Khi orchestrator spawn subagent (`Task` tool) sinh narration cho user, prompt phải include hint: "Output user-facing text bằng tiếng Việt; thuật ngữ tiếng Anh phải có gloss VN trong ngoặc lần đầu xuất hiện. Tham khảo `_shared/term-glossary.md`."

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added — Pre-discussion doc scan (auto-fill foundation từ existing docs)

User feedback: Khi `/vg:project` chạy, phải scan tất cả docs hiện có để auto-fill PROJECT/FOUNDATION artifacts. Chỉ coi là "project mới" khi 100% trống — README/CLAUDE.md/package.json/.planning đều bị bỏ qua trước đây.

v1.7.0 thêm step `0c_scan_existing_docs` chạy sau state detection, **luôn** scan trừ khi đã có FOUNDATION.md authoritative hoặc đang resume draft. Output: `.planning/.project-scan.json` + console summary.

### Scan sources (10 nhóm)

1. **README** — `README.md`, `README.vi.md`, `readme.md` (extract title + first paragraph)
2. **package.json** — name, description, dependencies → infer React/Vite/Next/Vue/Svelte/Fastify/Express/MongoDB/Postgres/Prisma/Playwright/Vitest/Expo/Electron/etc.
3. **Other manifests** — Cargo.toml (Rust), go.mod (Go), pubspec.yaml (Flutter), requirements.txt/pyproject.toml (Python), Gemfile (Ruby)
4. **Monorepo** — pnpm-workspace.yaml + turbo.json, nx.json, lerna.json, rush.json
5. **Infra/hosting** — infra/ansible/, Dockerfile, vercel.json, netlify.toml, fly.toml, render.yaml, railway.json, serverless.yml, AWS SAM, wrangler.toml (Cloudflare), .github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml
6. **Auth code** — apps/*/src/**/auth*, src/**/auth* directory detection
7. **CLAUDE.md** — extract `## Project` / `## Overview` / `## About` section as description (per VG convention)
8. **Brief/spec docs** — docs/**/*.md, BRIEF.md, SPEC.md, RFC*.md, *-brief.md, *-spec.md
9. **`.planning/` deep scan** (NEW per user request):
   - PROJECT.md (legacy v1) → name + description fallback
   - REQUIREMENTS.md → count REQ-XX items
   - ROADMAP.md → count phases
   - STATE.md → pipeline progress snapshot
   - SCOPE.md / PROJECT-SCOPE.md
   - **phases/** → count dirs + classify (accepted = has UAT.md, in-progress = has SUMMARY.md but no UAT.md), list latest 3 phase titles
   - intel/, codebase/, research/, design-normalized/, milestones/ → file counts
   - All loose `.planning/*.md` files
10. **vg.config.md** — already-confirmed config (highest trust signal)

### State upgrades

If scan results are "rich" (name + description + ≥2 tech buckets + ≥1 doc):
- `greenfield` → `greenfield-with-docs` (skip pure first-time, jump to confirm/adjust scan results)
- `brownfield-fresh` → `brownfield-with-docs`

This means project có README + package.json không còn bị treat như "blank slate".

### Files

- `commands/vg/project.md` — step `0c_scan_existing_docs` (NEW, ~150 lines Python in heredoc)
- Output artifact: `.planning/.project-scan.json` (machine-readable scan results, consumed by Round 2 to pre-populate foundation table)

### Migration

Existing v1.6.x users: no breaking change. Next `/vg:project` invocation will scan + show richer info, but artifacts unchanged unless user explicitly chooses update/migrate/rewrite.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-17

### Changed (UX — auto-scan + state-tailored menu)

User feedback: "không nhớ nên gõ args nào đâu" — `/vg:project --view` / `--migrate` / `--update` etc. requires user to remember flag names. v1.6.0's mode menu only fired when artifacts exist + no flag passed.

v1.6.1 makes auto-scan and proactive suggestion the **default behavior** for every `/vg:project` invocation, regardless of args:

- **Always print state summary table FIRST** — files exist (with mtime age), draft status, codebase detection, classified state category (greenfield / brownfield-fresh / legacy-v1 / fully-initialized / draft-in-progress).
- **State-tailored menus** — different option sets shown per state, with ⭐ RECOMMENDED action highlighted:
  - `legacy-v1` → recommend `[m] Migrate`, alt: view/rewrite/cancel
  - `brownfield-fresh` → recommend `[f] First-time với codebase scan`, alt: pure-text/cancel
  - `fully-initialized` → full menu: view/update/milestone/rewrite/cancel
  - `greenfield` → straight to Round 1 capture (no menu — most common new case)
  - `draft-in-progress` → resume/discard/view-draft (priority)
- **Flag mismatch validation** — explicit flags validated against state. `--migrate` on greenfield → friendly hint to use first-time instead, exit 0 (no error).
- User chỉ cần gõ `/vg:project` — workflow tự dẫn dắt, không cần đoán flag.

### Files

- `commands/vg/project.md` — step `0b_print_state_summary` (NEW) + `1_route_mode` rewritten with state-tailored menus

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed (BREAKING UX — entry point flow rebuild)

User feedback identified chicken-and-egg in old pipeline: `/vg:init` ran first asking for tech config (build commands, ports, framework markers) before `/vg:project` defined what the project is. Greenfield projects had to guess; brownfield felt redundant.

**v1.6.0 swaps the order: `/vg:project` is now the entry point.** It captures user's natural-language description, derives FOUNDATION (8 platform/runtime/data/auth/hosting/distribution/scale/compliance dimensions), then auto-generates `vg.config.md` from foundation. Config is downstream of foundation, not upstream.

### Added — `/vg:project` 7-round adaptive discussion + 6 modes

- **First-time flow** (7 rounds, adaptive — skip rounds without ambiguity, never skip Round 4 high-cost gate):
  1. Capture (free-form description or template-guided)
  2. Parse + present overview table (8 dimensions with status flags ✓/?/⚠/🔒)
  3. Targeted dialog on `?` ambiguous items
  4. **High-cost confirmation gate** (mandatory — platform/backend/deploy/DB)
  5. Constraints fill-in (scale/latency/compliance/budget/team)
  6. Auto-derive `vg.config.md` from foundation (90% silent, only `<ASK>` fields prompted)
  7. Atomic write 3 files: `PROJECT.md` + `FOUNDATION.md` + `vg.config.md`

- **Re-run modes** (when artifacts exist):
  - `--view` — Pretty-print, read-only (default safe)
  - `--update` — MERGE-preserving update (covers refine + amend, adaptive scope)
  - `--milestone` — Append milestone (foundation untouched, drift warning if shift)
  - `--rewrite` — Destructive reset with backup → `.archive/{ts}/`
  - `--migrate` — Extract FOUNDATION.md from legacy v1 PROJECT.md + codebase scan
  - `--init-only` — Re-derive vg.config.md from existing FOUNDATION.md

- **Resumable drafts** — `.planning/.project-draft.json` checkpointed every round, interrupt-safe.

### Added — `/vg:_shared/foundation-drift.md` (soft warning helper)

Wired into `/vg:roadmap` (step 4b) and `/vg:add-phase` (step 1b). Scans phase title/description for keywords (mobile/iOS/Android/serverless/desktop/embedded/...) that suggest platform shift away from FOUNDATION.md. Soft warning only — does NOT block. User proceeds with acknowledgment, drift entry logged for milestone audit. Silence with `--no-drift-check`.

### Changed — `/vg:init` is now SOFT ALIAS

`/vg:init` no longer creates `vg.config.md` from scratch. It detects state and redirects:

| State | Redirect |
|-------|----------|
| No artifacts | Suggest `/vg:project` (first-time) |
| Legacy PROJECT.md only | Suggest `/vg:project --migrate` |
| FOUNDATION.md present | Confirm + auto-chain `/vg:project --init-only` |

Backward-compat preserved — old workflows still work, just with redirect notice.

### Files

- **NEW** `commands/vg/_shared/foundation-drift.md` (drift detection helper)
- **REWRITTEN** `commands/vg/project.md` (~520 lines — 7-round + 6 modes + atomic writes)
- **REWRITTEN** `commands/vg/init.md` (~80 lines — soft alias only)
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/roadmap.md` (+ step 4b foundation drift check)
- **MODIFIED** `commands/vg/add-phase.md` (+ step 1b foundation drift check)

### Migration

Existing projects with `PROJECT.md` but no `FOUNDATION.md`:
```
/vg:project --migrate
```
Auto-extracts foundation from existing PROJECT.md + codebase scan, slim down PROJECT.md, backup v1 to `.planning/.archive/{ts}/`.

### Known limitations

- 7-round flow is heavy by design (high-precision projects). No `--quick` mode in this release.
- Drift detection regex-based (keyword match), not semantic. May miss subtle shifts (e.g., "Progressive Web App" with PWA-specific tooling).
- Codex skill (`vg-project`) NOT updated in this release — Codex parity will land in v1.6.1+.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added — Codex parity for UNREACHABLE triage (v1.4.0 backport to Codex skills)

v1.4.0 added UNREACHABLE triage to Claude commands (`/vg:review` + `/vg:accept`) but Codex skills (`$vg-review` + `$vg-accept`) were not updated. v1.5.1 closes the gap so phases reviewed/accepted under either harness get the same gate.

- **`codex-skills/vg-review/SKILL.md`** step 4e: UNREACHABLE triage runs after gate evaluation, produces `UNREACHABLE-TRIAGE.md` + `.unreachable-triage.json` (same Python helper as Claude).
- **`codex-skills/vg-accept/SKILL.md`** step 3 (after sandbox verdict gate): hard gate blocks accept if any verdict is `bug-this-phase`, `cross-phase-pending`, or `scope-amend`. Override via `--allow-unreachable --reason='...'` (logged to `build-state.log`).

Note: v1.5.0's TodoWrite ban does NOT apply to Codex (Codex CLI has no TodoWrite tool — different harness, different tail UI).

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed (BREAKING UX — show-step mechanism rebuild)

End-to-end re-evaluation of progress narration found 8 bugs across 4 layered mechanisms (TodoWrite, session_start banner, session_mark_step, narrate_phase). v1.3.3's TODOWRITE_POLICY softfix was insufficient because it was conditional ("if you use TodoWrite") — model rationalized opt-out, items still got stuck.

**TodoWrite/TaskCreate/TaskUpdate are now BANNED in `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:build`.**

Why TodoWrite was the wrong abstraction:
1. Persists across sessions until next TodoWrite call (stuck-tail symptom)
2. Long Task subagent (30 min) blocks all updates → Ctrl+C = items stuck forever
3. Bash echo / EXIT trap can't reach TodoWrite (model-only tool)
4. Subagent's TodoWrite goes to its own conversation, not parent UI
5. Conditional policy gets skipped by model

### Added — replacement narration

- **Markdown headers in model text output** between tool calls (e.g. `## ━━━ Phase 2b-1: Navigator ━━━`). Visible in message stream, does NOT persist after session.
- **`run_in_background: true` + `BashOutput` polling** for any Bash > 30s — user sees stdout live instead of blank wait.
- **1-line text BEFORE + 1-line summary AFTER** for any `Task` subagent > 2 min.
- **Bash echo / `session_start` banner** demoted to audit-log role only — useful for run history, NOT live UX (lands in tool result block, only visible after Bash returns).

### Modified

- `commands/vg/review.md`, `test.md`, `build.md`:
  - Removed `<TODOWRITE_POLICY>` block, replaced with `<NARRATION_POLICY>` block at top
  - Removed `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate` from `allowed-tools`; added `BashOutput`
- `commands/vg/_shared/session-lifecycle.md`:
  - Replaced TodoWrite policy section with full bug map (8 bugs) + narration replacement table
  - `session_start` / EXIT trap retained but documented as audit log, not live UX

### Migration

Existing stuck TodoWrite items will clear once a v1.5.0 `/vg:review` (or `/vg:test`, `/vg:build`) runs in the session — orchestrator no longer creates new TodoWrite items, so the status tail naturally empties as Claude Code GC's stale state at next session restart.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added — UNREACHABLE Triage (closes silent-debt loophole)

UNREACHABLE goals from `/vg:review` were previously "tracked separately" and accepted silently. They are bugs (or fictional roadmap entries) until proven otherwise. New triage system classifies each one and gates accept on unresolved verdicts.

- **New shared helper `_shared/unreachable-triage.md`**:
  - `triage_unreachable_goals()` — for each UNREACHABLE goal, extract distinctive keywords (route paths, PascalCase symbols, quoted UI labels), scan all other phase artifacts (PLAN/SUMMARY/RUNTIME-MAP/TEST-GOALS/SPECS/CONTEXT/API-CONTRACTS), classify into one of 4 verdicts:
    - `cross-phase:{X.Y}` — owning phase exists, accepted, AND verified in its RUNTIME-MAP.json (proof of reachability)
    - `cross-phase-pending:{X.Y}` — owning phase exists but not yet accepted → BLOCK current accept
    - `bug-this-phase` — current SPECS/CONTEXT mentions the keywords but no phase claims it → **BUG**, BLOCK accept
    - `scope-amend` — no phase claims it AND current SPECS doesn't mention → BLOCK accept (`/vg:amend` to remove or `/vg:add-phase` to create owner)
  - `unreachable_triage_accept_gate()` — read `.unreachable-triage.json`, exit 1 if any blocking verdict outstanding
- **`/vg:review` step `unreachable_triage`** (after gate evaluation, before crossai_review): runs triage, writes `UNREACHABLE-TRIAGE.md` (human-readable, evidence per goal) + `.unreachable-triage.json` (machine-readable). Does NOT block review exit — only `/vg:accept` enforces.
- **`/vg:accept` step `3b_unreachable_triage_gate`**: hard gate before UAT checklist. Blocks unless `--allow-unreachable --reason='<why>'` provided. Override is logged to override-debt register and surfaces in UAT.md "Unreachable Debt" section + `/vg:telemetry`.
- **UAT.md template** gains `## B.1 UNREACHABLE Triage` section: Resolved (cross-phase) entries plus Unreachable Debt table when override was used.
- Cross-phase verification reads target phase's RUNTIME-MAP.json (proof of runtime reachability), not just claims in PLAN.md — prevents fictional cross-phase citations.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (UX — stuck UI tail across runs)
- **Stuck TodoWrite items hanging in Claude Code's "Baking…" / "Hullaballooing…" status box across `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:build` runs** — items like "Phase 2b-1: Navigator", "Start pnpm dev + wait health" persisted from interrupted previous runs because TodoWrite list wasn't reset/cleared.
- **Root cause:** v1.3.0 session lifecycle banner only displaces `echo` narration tail, not TodoWrite items (which are model-only, bash trap can't touch them).
- **Fix:** Added `<TODOWRITE_POLICY>` directive block at top of `commands/vg/review.md`, `test.md`, `build.md`. Tells executing model:
  1. FIRST tool call MUST be a TodoWrite that REPLACES stale items (overwrites entire list)
  2. Mark each item `completed` immediately when done — don't batch
  3. Exit path (success OR error) MUST leave NO `pending`/`in_progress` items
  4. Better default: prefer `narrate_phase` (echo) over TodoWrite for granular per-step progress
- Companion update in `_shared/session-lifecycle.md` documents the symptom + recommended pattern (≤7 top-level milestones max for TodoWrite, echo for everything else).

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (CRITICAL — extend preservation gate to all migrate steps)
- **`/vg:migrate` steps 5, 6, 7 also had overwrite-without-diff risk** (v1.3.1 only fixed step 4 CONTEXT.md):
  - Step 5 **API-CONTRACTS.md**: `--force` case overwrote existing without preserving endpoint paths
  - Step 6 **TEST-GOALS.md**: `--force` case overwrote existing without preserving G-XX goals + bodies
  - Step 7 **PLAN.md attribution**: Agent trusted to "only add attributes" but no verification — task descriptions could be silently rewritten/dropped
- **Fix:** All 4 mutation steps (4/5/6/7) now write to `{file}.staged` first. Preservation gates before promote:
  - IDs preserved (D-XX, G-XX, Task N, endpoint paths — depending on artifact type)
  - Body similarity ≥ 80% (difflib.SequenceMatcher) — attribute-stripped for PLAN.md
  - On fail: original untouched, staging kept at `{file}.staged`, backup in `.gsd-backup/`
- **Universal rule added to `<rules>` block**: "MERGE, DO NOT OVERWRITE" — codifies staging+diff+gate pattern for any future migrate step or similar mutation command.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed (CRITICAL — data safety)
- **`/vg:migrate` step 4 `_enrich_context` was losing decisions silently** — agent wrote directly to `CONTEXT.md`, overwriting original. If agent dropped or merged D-XX decisions, they were **permanently lost** (backup in `.gsd-backup/` but no automatic diff/rollback).
- **Fix:** Agent now writes to `CONTEXT.md.enriched` staging file. Three gates run before promoting to `CONTEXT.md`:
  1. **Decision-ID preservation**: every `D-XX` in original must exist in staging (missing → abort, no overwrite)
  2. **Body-preservation**: each decision body must be ≥ 80% similar to original (rewritten prose → abort)
  3. **Sub-section coverage**: warns if `**Endpoints:**` count ≠ decision count (non-fatal)
- Only if all 3 gates pass → staging promoted to `CONTEXT.md` atomically. On failure, staging preserved for user review; original CONTEXT.md untouched.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Session lifecycle helper** (`_shared/session-lifecycle.md`) wired into `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:build` — emits session-start banner + EXIT trap for clean tail UI across runs
- Stale state auto-sweep (configurable `session.stale_hours`, default 1h) — removes leftover `.review-state.json` / `.test-state.json` from previous interrupted runs
- Cross-platform port sweep (Windows netstat/taskkill + Linux lsof/kill) — kills orphan dev servers before new run
- Config: `session.stale_hours`, `session.port_sweep_on_start`

### Fixed
- Stuck "Phase 2b-1 / Phase 2b-2" items in Claude Code tail UI after interrupted `/vg:review` runs — EXIT trap now emits `━━━ EXITED at step=X ━━━` terminal marker

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Phase pipeline accuracy:** commands/docs consistently reference the correct 7-step pipeline `specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept` (was showing 6 steps, missing `specs` at front)
- `next.md` PIPELINE_STEPS order now includes `specs` — `/vg:next` can advance from specs-only state to scope
- `scripts/phase-recon.py` PIPELINE_STEPS now includes `specs` — phase reconnaissance detects specs-only phase correctly
- `phase.md` description, args, and inline docs reflect 7 steps
- `amend.md`, `blueprint.md`, `build.md`, `review.md`, `test.md` header pipelines include `specs` prefix
- `init.md` help text reflects 7-step phase pipeline

### Added
- `README.vi.md` — Vietnamese translation of README with cross-link back to English
- `README.md` — rewritten with clear 2-tier pipeline explanation (project setup + per-phase execution)
- Both READMEs now show the project-level setup chain (`/vg:init → /vg:project → /vg:roadmap → /vg:map → /vg:prioritize`) before the per-phase pipeline

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- `/vg:update` command — pull latest release from GitHub, 3-way merge with local edits, park conflicts in `.claude/vgflow-patches/`
- `/vg:reapply-patches` command — interactive per-conflict resolution (edit / keep-upstream / restore-local / skip)
- `scripts/vg_update.py` — Python helper implementing SemVer compare, SHA256 verify, 3-way merge via `git merge-file`, patches manifest persistence, GitHub release API query
- `/vg:progress` version banner — shows installed VG version + daily update check (lazy-cached)
- `migrations/template.md` — template for breaking-change migration guides
- Release tarball auto-build: GitHub Action builds + attaches `vgflow-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` + `.sha256` per tag

### Fixed
- Windows Python text mode CRLF translation in 3-way merge tmp file (caused false conflicts against LF-terminated ancestor files)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- Initial public release of VGFlow
- 6-step pipeline: scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept
- Config-driven engine via `vg.config.md` — zero hardcoded stack values
- `install.sh` for fresh project install
- `sync.sh` for dev-side source↔mirror sync
- Claude Code commands (`commands/vg/`) + shared helpers
- Codex CLI skills parity (`codex-skills/vg-review`, `vg-test`)
- Gemini CLI skills parity (`gemini-skills/`)
- Python scripts for graphify, caller graph, visual diff, phase recon
- Commit-msg hook template enforcing citation + SemVer task IDs
- Infrastructure: override debt register, i18n narration, telemetry, security register, visual regression, incremental graphify
