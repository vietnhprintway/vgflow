## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$flow-scan`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.

# Flow Scan — State Machine Extraction

Scan codebase for state machine definitions and produce a structured FLOW-REGISTRY.md that downstream skills (flow-spec, flow-codegen, flow-runner) consume.

**Called by:** `/rtb:test-specs` Step 9a
**Input:** Phase number
**Output:** `.planning/phases/{phase}/{phase}-FLOW-REGISTRY.md`

## Context Budget

This skill spawns 3 subagents. Each agent reads ONE source only — no cross-reading.

| Subagent | Reads | Does NOT Read |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| backend-scanner | `apps/api/src/modules/` | React code, BUSINESS-FLOW-SPECS |
| frontend-scanner | `apps/web/src/` | API code, BUSINESS-FLOW-SPECS |
| business-flow-reader | `.planning/BUSINESS-FLOW-SPECS.md` | Source code |

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Phase Modules

Read `{phase}/CONTEXT.md` to identify which API modules belong to this phase.
Example: Phase 07.3 → modules: `billing`, `funding`, `invoices`, `payouts`.

### Step 2: Spawn 3 Subagents in Parallel

**Subagent A — backend-scanner:**
```
Grep apps/api/src/modules/{modules}/ for these patterns:
- *STATES*, *STATUS*, *LIFECYCLE*, *TRANSITIONS*
- Enum-like const objects: const.*=.*{ (with state string values)
- Router files: POST/PUT methods that change a status field

For each state machine found, extract:
- Source file path
- State names (ordered by lifecycle)
- Transition definitions: from → to, trigger name, API endpoint, HTTP method
- Role required for each transition (from middleware/guards)

Output format:
## StateMachine: {name}
- Source: {file path}
- States: state1 → state2 → state3 → ...
### Transitions
| From | To | Trigger | Endpoint | Method | Role |
```

**Subagent B — frontend-scanner:**
```
Grep apps/web/src/ for these patterns:
- StatusBadge, badge, status.*variant, status.*color
- Conditional renders: status === '{value}' or status === "{value}"
- Route definitions in router files
- Buttons/actions conditional on status (disabled, hidden, visible per state)

For each state found, extract:
- Page/component showing this state
- Badge text and variant per state
- UI indicators (buttons enabled/disabled, sections visible/hidden)
- Navigation: which page transitions to which

Output format:
## UI: {state-machine-name}
### Per State
| State | Page | Badge Text | Visible Actions | Hidden Elements |
```

**Subagent C — business-flow-reader:**
```
Read .planning/BUSINESS-FLOW-SPECS.md
Filter flows that match this phase's modules.

For each matching flow, extract:
- Flow name and priority
- Step sequence with actions and expected outcomes
- Business rules not obvious from code (approval thresholds, time limits, auto-triggers)
- Roles involved at each step

Output format:
## BusinessFlow: {name}
- Priority: P0/P1/P2
- Steps: N
### Steps
| # | Role | Action | Expected | Business Rule |
```

### Step 3: Merge Results

**Merge rules:**
1. Backend-scanner = source of truth for states and transitions
2. Frontend-scanner supplements: add Page and UI Indicator columns to each state
3. Business-flow-reader supplements: add business context + detect gaps
4. **Gap detection:** If a flow exists in BUSINESS-FLOW-SPECS but no matching state machine in code → mark as `GAP: not yet implemented`
5. **Conflict resolution:** If frontend shows a state not in backend → mark as `UNVERIFIED: UI-only state`

### Step 4: Write FLOW-REGISTRY.md

Write to `.planning/phases/{phase}/{phase}-FLOW-REGISTRY.md` with this format:

```markdown
---
phase: {phase}
type: flow-registry
flows_found: {N}
total_transitions: {M}
gaps: {K}
scanned_modules: [{module list}]
---

## Flow: {flow-name}

- **Source:** {backend file path}
- **States:** state1 → state2 → state3 → ...
- **Roles involved:** role1 (trigger X), role2 (trigger Y)

### Transitions

| # | From | To | Trigger | API Endpoint | Method | Role | Page |
|---|------|----|---------|-------------|--------|------|------|

### Data Assertions per State

| State | UI Indicator | Badge Text | Key Data |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------|

### Cross-Page Navigation

| Step | Start Page | Action | End Page |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
```

### Step 5: Report

Print summary: `{N} flows found, {M} transitions, {K} gaps (flows in business-spec not in code)`.

If 0 flows found → print "No state machines detected — skipping flow-spec generation."

## Anti-Patterns

- DO NOT read entire source files — grep patterns then read surrounding 20 lines for context
- DO NOT let 1 subagent read both backend + frontend code
- DO NOT hallucinate states not found in code — if uncertain, mark as `UNVERIFIED`
- DO NOT include simple CRUD status fields (e.g., `active/inactive` toggles) — only multi-step lifecycles with 3+ states
- If grep returns > 20 matches for a pattern → narrow by phase module paths from CONTEXT.md
