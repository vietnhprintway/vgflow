## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$test-scan`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.

# Test Scan — Component & Page Inventory

Scan HTML prototypes + React components + API modules for a phase. Classify every component by depth. Output structured COMPONENT-MAP.md.

**Called by:** `/rtb:test-specs` Step 1
**Input:** Phase number + phase artifacts (CONTEXT.md, PLAN*.md, SPECS.md)
**Output:** `.planning/phases/{phase}/{phase}-COMPONENT-MAP.md`

## Process

### 1. Read Phase Context (what to scan)

```bash
PHASE_DIR=$(ls -d .planning/phases/${PHASE}*)
cat "$PHASE_DIR"/CONTEXT.md       # Decisions → what features exist
cat "$PHASE_DIR"/*-PLAN*.md       # Tasks → what pages/components were built
```

Extract: which API modules, which React pages, which HTML prototypes belong to this phase.

### 2. Build Goal Matrix

Combine goals from ALL sources into structured list:

| Source | Pattern | Extract |
|--------|---------|---------|
| CONTEXT.md | `D-XX:` lines | Decision → test assertion |
| ROADMAP.md | Phase success criteria | Criterion → verification point |
| SPECS.md | Success criteria section | Criterion → test step |
| TEST-STRATEGY.md | Phase section | Recommended test files |
| BUSINESS-FLOW-SPECS.md | Overlapping flows | Flow steps to extend |

### 3. Identify Pages + Map to Sources

| Feature | HTML Prototype | React Component | API Module |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| (from plans) | `html/.../*.html` | `apps/web/src/pages/*.tsx` | `apps/api/src/modules/*` |

### 4. Deep HTML Scan (hidden modals)

For each HTML page in scope:

**4a. Surface elements:** grep tables, KPI cards, toolbar, buttons, tabs
**4b. Hidden modals (MUST NOT SKIP):**
```bash
grep -n "modal-overlay\|id=\".*[Mm]odal\|class=\".*modal" "$HTML_FILE"
```
For EACH modal: extract title, ALL form fields (input/select/textarea), tables inside, tabs inside, conditional sections.

**4c. Hidden elements outside modals:** dropdown menus, inactive tabs, conditional form sections, confirmation dialogs.

**4d. Inline JS handlers:** `onclick`, `onchange`, `onsubmit` → map to functions that show/hide modals.

### 5. React Component Audit

For each React component (.tsx):
- **Columns:** `ColumnDef`, `createColumnHelper` → exact header text
- **Modals/Drawers:** `<Dialog>`, `<Modal>`, `<Sheet>` → trigger, title, fields, submit
- **KPI cards:** `StatsCard`, grid patterns → labels, value sources
- **Form fields:** `<Input>`, `<Select>`, react-hook-form → names, validation
- **Query hooks:** `useQuery`, `useMutation` → endpoints, methods
- **DataTable row actions:** For EVERY action column → trace what opens, what data it reads, what secondary API it calls

### 6. Classify Components by Depth

```
DEEP (any 1 signal):
  - imports useMutation / api.post/put/delete
  - onSubmit handler calling API
  - useAuth / role-based conditional
  - router.push / navigate (cross-page)
  - dispatch to global store
  - WebSocket/SSE subscription

INTERACTIVE (handlers but no API):
  - onClick/onChange modifying local state
  - Filter/sort/search without API

SHALLOW (everything else):
  - Receives props, renders JSX only
```

### 7. Gap Analysis

Build comparison matrix per page:
```
| Widget | HTML | React | Status |
| Modal  | HTML | React | Status |
| API    | Route exists? | Response shape matches component? |
```

### 8. Write COMPONENT-MAP.md

```markdown
---
phase: {phase}
pages: {N}
components_total: {N}
shallow: {N}
interactive: {N}
deep: {N}
modals_found: {N}
goals_mapped: {N}
---

## Goal Matrix
| ID | Source | Description | Page | Priority |

## Pages
### Page: {name}
- HTML: {path}
- React: {path}
- API: {module}

#### Modals (from HTML scan)
| Modal | Fields | In React? | Status |

#### Components by Depth
| Component | Depth | Signals | Key Actions |

#### Gap Analysis
| Widget/Modal | HTML | React | Gap? |
```

## Anti-Patterns
- DO NOT skip hidden modals — #1 source of missed coverage
- DO NOT skip DataTable row action tracing — #2 source of missed bugs
- DO NOT classify based on component name alone — check actual imports
- DO NOT read component implementation deeply — that's test-depth's job. Just classify.
