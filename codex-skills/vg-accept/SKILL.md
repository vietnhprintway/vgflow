## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Do NOT blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-accept`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.

<rules>
1. **All pipeline artifacts required** — SPECS → CONTEXT → PLAN → API-CONTRACTS → TEST-GOALS → SUMMARY → RUNTIME-MAP → GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX → SANDBOX-TEST. CRUD-SURFACES is required when the phase touches CRUD/resource behavior. Missing = BLOCK.
2. **Step markers mandatory** — every profile-applicable step from /vg:build, /vg:review, /vg:test MUST have its `.step-markers/{step}.done` file. Missing = BLOCK (AI skipped silently).
3. **SANDBOX-TEST verdict gate** — must be `PASSED` or `GAPS_FOUND`. `FAILED` → BLOCK with redirect.
4. **UAT is data-driven** — checklist items are GENERATED from VG artifacts (`P{phase}.D-XX` from CONTEXT, `F-XX` from FOUNDATION if cited in any phase artifact, G-XX from TEST-GOALS, HIGH callers from RIPPLE-ANALYSIS, design-refs from PLAN). No hardcoded checks. Bare `D-XX` treated as legacy — displayed with "(legacy)" suffix.
5. **No auto-accept** — every non-N/A item requires explicit user Pass/Fail/Skip.
6. **Ripple gate** — if RIPPLE-ANALYSIS has HIGH severity callers, user MUST acknowledge each before proceeding.
7. **Write UAT.md atomic** — at end, all results persisted. Rejected phase still writes UAT.md (audit trail).
8. **Zero hardcode** — all paths from `$REPO_ROOT`, `$PHASE_DIR`, `$PYTHON_BIN`, etc. resolved by config-loader.
</rules>

<objective>
Step 6 of V6 pipeline (final). Data-driven Human UAT over VG artifacts — not a generic GSD verify pass. User reviews each decision, goal, ripple, design ref explicitly.

Pipeline: specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test → **accept**
</objective>

**Gate 3b: UNREACHABLE triage gate (added 2026-04-17)**

Rationale: UNREACHABLE goals previously got "tracked separately" and shipped silently. They are bugs (or fictional roadmap entries) until proven otherwise. The triage produced by `/vg:review` distinguishes legitimate cross-phase ownership from bugs — only `cross-phase:{X.Y}` (owner already accepted + runtime-verified) is acceptance-safe.

**Gate 3c: Override resolution gate (T5 — event-based, v1.8.0+)**

⛔ HARD GATE: if the override-debt register contains OPEN entries that are NOT resolved by a telemetry event (and NOT explicitly `--wont-fix`), BLOCK accept. Time-based expiry is BANNED — an override only clears when its bypassed gate re-runs cleanly OR the user explicitly declines to fix.

Rationale (from M9 claude reviewer): prior `auto_expire_days` model silently forgave real debt. An override entry must stay OPEN until either (a) the bypassed gate re-runs cleanly (auto-resolved via telemetry `override_resolved` event correlation), or (b) the user explicitly marks `--wont-fix` with justification.

        print(f"{fid}\t{title}")
PY
fi
```

### Section B: Goals (from TEST-GOALS.md + GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md)

Parse goals + their coverage status. Items: "Goal G-XX verified working?" for each READY goal. BLOCKED/UNREACHABLE goals flagged as known gaps.

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-goals.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
goals_text = Path("${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
coverage_path = Path("${PHASE_DIR}/GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md")
coverage = coverage_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8") if coverage_path.exists() else ""

for m in re.finditer(r'^##?\s*(G-\d+)[:\s-]+([^\n]+)', goals_text, re.MULTILINE):
    gid = m.group(1)
    title = m.group(2).strip().rstrip('*').strip()[:100]
    # Look up status in coverage matrix (simple substring)
    status = "UNKNOWN"
    for line in coverage.splitlines():
        if gid in line:
            for tag in ("READY", "BLOCKED", "UNREACHABLE", "PARTIAL"):
                if tag in line.upper():
                    status = tag
                    break
            break
    print(f"{gid}\t{status}\t{title}")
PY
```

### Section B.1: CRUD surfaces (from CRUD-SURFACES.md)

Parse each resource contract into UAT rows. These are the human-facing
checkpoints for list/read/create/update/delete surfaces: headings,
descriptions, filters, search, sort, paging, table columns/actions, form
validation, duplicate-submit guard, delete confirmation, object/field auth,
CSRF/XSS posture, rate limit, abuse guards, audit log, and performance budget.

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-crud-surfaces.txt"
import json
import re
from pathlib import Path

path = Path("${PHASE_DIR}/CRUD-SURFACES.md")
if not path.exists():
    raise SystemExit(0)
text = path.read_text(encoding="utf-8", errors="replace")
m = re.search(r"```(?:json|crud-surface)\s*(\{.*?\})\s*```", text, re.DOTALL)
raw = m.group(1) if m else text.strip()
try:
    data = json.loads(raw)
except Exception as exc:
    print(f"INVALID\tparse-error\t{exc}")
    raise SystemExit(0)

for resource in data.get("resources", []):
    if not isinstance(resource, dict):
        continue
    name = resource.get("name", "<unnamed>")
    ops = ",".join(resource.get("operations", []))
    platforms = resource.get("platforms", {}) if isinstance(resource.get("platforms"), dict) else {}
    overlays = ",".join(sorted(platforms.keys()))
    checkpoints = []
    if "web" in platforms:
        checkpoints.extend(["web:list/form/delete", "web:url-state", "web:a11y-states"])
    if "mobile" in platforms:
        checkpoints.extend(["mobile:deep-link", "mobile:tap-target", "mobile:offline/network"])
    if "backend" in platforms:
        checkpoints.extend(["backend:query-contract", "backend:authz/csrf", "backend:abuse/perf"])
    base = resource.get("base", {}) if isinstance(resource.get("base"), dict) else {}
    if base:
        checkpoints.extend(["base:business-flow", "base:security", "base:delete-policy"])
    print(f"{name}\t{ops}\t{overlays}\t{', '.join(dict.fromkeys(checkpoints))}")
PY
```

### Section C: Ripple acknowledgment (from RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md or .ripple.json)

If ripple data exists, HIGH-severity callers need explicit acknowledgment.

```bash
RIPPLE_JSON="${PHASE_DIR}/.ripple.json"
RIPPLE_MD="${PHASE_DIR}/RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md"

if [ -f "$RIPPLE_JSON" ]; then
  ${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-ripples.txt"
import json
from pathlib import Path
d = json.loads(Path("$RIPPLE_JSON").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
count = 0
for r in d.get("ripples", []):
    for c in r.get("callers", []):
        # Print one line per unique caller (dedup in bash later)
        print(f"{c['file']}:{c.get('line','?')}\t{c.get('symbol','?')}\t{r['changed_file']}")
        count += 1
print(f"# TOTAL_CALLERS={count}", flush=True)
PY
elif [ -f "$RIPPLE_MD" ]; then
  # Check if RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md is a "SKIPPED" stub (graphify was unavailable)
  if grep -qi "SKIPPED\|unavailable\|not available\|stub" "$RIPPLE_MD" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "# RIPPLE_SKIPPED=true" > "${VG_TMP}/uat-ripples.txt"
  else
    : > "${VG_TMP}/uat-ripples.txt"
  fi
else
  # No ripple data at all — no gate
  : > "${VG_TMP}/uat-ripples.txt"
fi
```

### Section D: Design fidelity (if phase has <design-ref>)

Extract <design-ref> attributes from PLAN tasks. Each becomes a spot-check item.
For mobile profiles, ALSO emit simulator/emulator screenshots captured during
`phase2_mobile_discovery` — each screenshot is a "built output" candidate to
visually compare against the design-ref.

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-designs.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
for plan in Path("${PHASE_DIR}").glob("*PLAN*.md"):
    text = plan.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    for m in re.finditer(r'<design-ref>([^<]+)</design-ref>', text):
        ref = m.group(1).strip()
        # ref format like "sites-list.default" or "sites-list.modal-add"
        print(ref)
PY
# Dedupe
sort -u "${VG_TMP}/uat-designs.txt" -o "${VG_TMP}/uat-designs.txt"

# Mobile-only: collect simulator/emulator screenshots from phase2_mobile_discovery.
# These sit in ${PHASE_DIR}/discover/ and are named like "G-XX-ios.png", "G-XX-android.png".
# We write them to uat-mobile-screenshots.txt — interactive step shows path so user
# opens file manager to compare vs design-normalized ref.
: > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-screenshots.txt"
case "$PROFILE" in
  mobile-*)
    if [ -d "${PHASE_DIR}/discover" ]; then
      find "${PHASE_DIR}/discover" -maxdepth 2 -type f \
        \( -name '*.png' -o -name '*.jpg' -o -name '*.jpeg' \) 2>/dev/null \
        | sort > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-screenshots.txt"
    fi
    ;;
esac
```

### Section E: Deliverables summary (from SUMMARY*.md — for spot-check only)

High-level summary of what was built — presented to user as context, not gated.

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-summary.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
for summary in sorted(Path("${PHASE_DIR}").glob("*SUMMARY*.md")):
    text = summary.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    # Extract "## Task N — title" or similar
    for m in re.finditer(r'^##?\s*(Task\s+\d+|Deliverable\s*\d+)[:\s-]+([^\n]+)', text, re.MULTILINE):
        title = m.group(2).strip().rstrip('*').strip()[:100]
        print(f"{summary.name}\t{m.group(1)}\t{title}")
PY
```

### Section F: Mobile gates (mobile profiles only)

Parse `build-state.log` for `mobile-gate-N: <name> status=<passed|failed|skipped> [reason=...] ts=...`
lines. Each gate becomes an acknowledgment row: user confirms the outcome makes
sense (e.g., "Gate 7 skipped because signing certs not yet provisioned — OK").

For web profiles this file stays empty and Section F is suppressed.

```bash
: > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-gates.txt"
case "$PROFILE" in
  mobile-*)
    BUILD_LOG="${PHASE_DIR}/build-state.log"
    if [ -f "$BUILD_LOG" ]; then
      ${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-gates.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
log = Path("${BUILD_LOG}").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
# Keep only the last entry per gate id — later runs overwrite earlier ones.
latest = {}
for m in re.finditer(r'mobile-gate-(\d+):\s*([a-z_]+)\s+status=(\w+)(?:\s+reason=([^\s]+))?\s*(?:ts=(\S+))?', log):
    gid, name, status, reason, ts = m.group(1), m.group(2), m.group(3), m.group(4) or '', m.group(5) or ''
    latest[gid] = (name, status, reason, ts)
# Emit in gate-id order (6,7,8,9,10)
for gid in sorted(latest.keys(), key=int):
    name, status, reason, ts = latest[gid]
    print(f"G{gid}\t{name}\t{status}\t{reason}\t{ts}")
PY
    fi
    ;;
esac

# Also collect mobile security audit findings if present (from /vg:test step 5f_mobile_security_audit)
: > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-security.txt"
case "$PROFILE" in
  mobile-*)
    SEC_REPORT="${PHASE_DIR}/mobile-security/report.md"
    if [ -f "$SEC_REPORT" ]; then
      # Surface the summary counts only (details live in the report file)
      grep -E "^(CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW)\|" "$SEC_REPORT" > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-security.txt" 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
    ;;
esac
```

**Now present SECTION COUNTS to user:**
```
UAT Checklist for Phase {PHASE_NUMBER}:
  Section A — Decisions (CONTEXT P{phase}.D-XX): {count} items
  Section A.1 — Foundation cites (F-XX):    {count} items (0 = none cited)
  Section B — Goals (TEST-GOALS G-XX):      {count} items
  Section B.1 — CRUD surfaces:              {count} resource rows
  Section C — Ripple callers (HIGH):        {count} callers need acknowledgment
  Section D — Design refs:                  {count} refs + {mobile_count} simulator shots
  Section E — Deliverables (summary):       {count} tasks
  Section F — Mobile gates (mobile only):   {count} gate rows + {N} sec findings  [OMITTED for web]
  Test verdict:                              {VERDICT from Gate 3}

Proceed with UAT? (y/n/abort)
```

If user aborts → stop, write UAT.md with status `ABORTED`.
</step>

<step name="4b_uat_narrative_autofire">
**Phase 15 D-10 — Auto-generate UAT-NARRATIVE.md before interactive UAT (NEW, 2026-04-27).**

Before stepping into the interactive checklist, render the per-prompt UAT
narrative document so the human tester opens it side-by-side with their
browser. The narrative is built from 4 frontmatter fields per goal
(`entry_url`, `navigation_steps`, `precondition`, `expected_behavior`)
plus design-ref blocks where present (D-10 spec). Strings come ONLY from
narration-strings.yaml — no hardcoded labels (D-18 strict enforcement).

The generator (`scripts/build-uat-narrative.py`) is deterministic, takes
no Sonnet round-trip, and idempotently overwrites `UAT-NARRATIVE.md`
each run so re-acceptance always reflects the latest TEST-GOALS state.
A sibling `UAT-NARRATIVE-OVERRIDES.md` (if present) is appended verbatim
at the end so manual prose can survive regeneration.

```bash
NARRATIVE_OUT="${PHASE_DIR}/UAT-NARRATIVE.md"
NARRATIVE_GEN="${REPO_ROOT}/.claude/scripts/build-uat-narrative.py"

if [ ! -f "$NARRATIVE_GEN" ]; then
  echo "⚠ build-uat-narrative.py missing — skipping narrative auto-fire (Phase 15 T5.1 not installed)" >&2
else
  ${PYTHON_BIN} "$NARRATIVE_GEN" \
      --phase-dir "${PHASE_DIR}" \
      --vg-config "${REPO_ROOT}/vg.config.md" \
      --output    "$NARRATIVE_OUT" \
      || {
        echo "⛔ UAT narrative generation failed — see stderr above." >&2
        echo "   Inspect TEST-GOALS frontmatter for missing entry_url / navigation_steps / precondition / expected_behavior." >&2
        exit 1
      }
  echo "✓ UAT-NARRATIVE.md written → ${NARRATIVE_OUT}"
fi

```

The interactive UAT in step 5 references this document — testers walk each
prompt with the narrative open in another window. The narrative does NOT
replace the interactive checklist; it provides the WHY/HOW context that
used to live only in tester memory.
</step>

<step name="5_interactive_uat">
**Run interactive checklist — one item at a time.**

For each section:

### A. Decisions
For each line in `${VG_TMP}/uat-decisions.txt`:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Decision {ID} (P{phase}.D-XX from CONTEXT, or legacy D-XX): {title}
   Was this implemented as specified in CONTEXT.md?

   [p] Pass — verified in code/runtime
   [f] Fail — not implemented correctly (note the issue)
   [s] Skip — cannot verify right now (deferred)"
```

### B. Goals
For each line in `${VG_TMP}/uat-goals.txt` where status = READY:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Goal {G-XX}: {title}   [STATUS: READY per coverage matrix]
   Verified working in runtime?

   [p] Pass — functions as TEST-GOALS.md success criteria
   [f] Fail — doesn't work / wrong behavior
   [s] Skip — not testable here (deferred)"
```

For BLOCKED/UNREACHABLE goals: show info block, no question asked:
```
  ⚠ Goal {G-XX}: {title}   [STATUS: BLOCKED/UNREACHABLE]
      Known gap — not gated here. Address in next phase or /vg:build --gaps-only.
```

### C. Ripple acknowledgment (MANDATORY if any HIGH callers)

**If `uat-ripples.txt` contains `RIPPLE_SKIPPED=true`** (graphify was unavailable):
```
⚠ Cross-module ripple analysis was SKIPPED (graphify unavailable during review).
  Downstream callers of changed symbols were NOT checked.
  Manual regression testing of affected modules is strongly advised.

  [y] Acknowledged — I will manually verify affected modules
  [s] Accept risk — proceed without ripple verification (recorded in UAT.md)
  [n] Abort — need to enable graphify and re-run /vg:review first
```

**Otherwise**, present the list, ask single acknowledgment question:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Ripple callers (HIGH severity) that were NOT updated in this phase:

   [list first 10, + '... and N more' if > 10]

   Each should have been manually reviewed or explicitly cited.
   Have you verified these callers still work with the changed symbols?

   [y] Yes — verified (per RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md + code review)
   [n] No — need to review before accepting (ABORT UAT)
   [s] Skip — accept risk (record in UAT.md)"
```

If `n` → abort UAT, write UAT.md status = `DEFERRED_PENDING_RIPPLE_REVIEW`.

### D. Design fidelity (if design refs exist)

**P19 D-06 — strict 3-file inspection when L4 produced diffs.** If
`${PHASE_DIR}/visual-fidelity/{ref}.diff.png` exists (the L4 review SSIM
gate produced a baseline-vs-current diff), surface ALL THREE files in the
prompt so the user can open them side-by-side. Reject = phase not
acceptable (returns to /vg:build with override-debt logged).

For each unique design-ref in `${VG_TMP}/uat-designs.txt`:

```bash
# v2.30+ 2-tier resolver — try phase-scoped first, shared fallback, legacy last
source "${REPO_ROOT:-.}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/design-path-resolver.sh"
BASELINE_PNG="$(vg_resolve_design_ref "{ref}" "screenshots/{ref}.default.png" "$PHASE_DIR" 2>/dev/null)"
if [ -z "$BASELINE_PNG" ]; then
  # Legacy compat absolute path for human-readable error
  DESIGN_DIR_REL_UAT="$(vg_design_legacy_dir 2>/dev/null || echo .vg/design-normalized)"
  BASELINE_PNG="${REPO_ROOT}/${DESIGN_DIR_REL_UAT}/screenshots/{ref}.default.png"
fi
DIFF_PNG="${PHASE_DIR}/visual-fidelity/{ref}.diff.png"
CURRENT_PNG="${PHASE_DIR}/visual-fidelity/{ref}.current.png"

if [ -f "$DIFF_PNG" ]; then
  PROMPT_BODY="Design ref: {ref}
   THREE files to open side-by-side (P19 D-06):
     baseline:  ${BASELINE_PNG}
     current:   ${CURRENT_PNG}
     diff:      ${DIFF_PNG}
   The diff PNG highlights pixel mismatches in red.
   Built output matches design (layout, spacing, components, copy)?"
else
  PROMPT_BODY="Design ref: {ref}
   Screenshot: ${REPO_ROOT}/${DESIGN_DIR_REL_UAT}/screenshots/{ref}.default.png
   (No L4 diff PNG produced — review browser may not have captured this view.)
   Built output matches screenshot (layout, spacing, components)?"
fi
```

```
AskUserQuestion:
  "${PROMPT_BODY}

   [p] Pass — visual match
   [f] Fail — significant drift (describe; logs override-debt kind=human-rejected-design)
   [s] Skip — no design ref available / cannot verify"
```

**Fail handling (P19 D-06):** if user picks `f` for any ref, write to
override-debt register (`kind=human-rejected-design`, severity=critical)
and abort UAT with status `REJECTED_DESIGN_DRIFT`. User must `/vg:build`
again to fix; debt entry resolved when rerun yields PASS.

**Mobile extension** (runs ONLY when `$PROFILE` matches `mobile-*`):
For each simulator/emulator screenshot in `${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-screenshots.txt`:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Simulator capture: {path}
   Captured by /vg:review phase2_mobile_discovery. Compare against closest
   design-ref (above) — does the running app match the intended layout?

   [p] Pass — visual match vs design-ref
   [f] Fail — drift (typography, color, spacing, or content off)
   [s] Skip — no matching design-ref to compare against"
```
If no screenshots exist (host lacked simulator/emulator), inform user:
```
  ⚠ No mobile screenshots captured — host OS/tooling could not run simulator/emulator.
    Section D mobile sub-checks skipped (expected on Windows for iOS).
```

### E. Deliverables (informational only — no per-item question)
Present `${VG_TMP}/uat-summary.txt` as a final summary block. No questions.

### F. Mobile gates (mobile profiles only — skipped for web)

Present the gate table from `${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-gates.txt`. Example:
```
  G6  permission_audit        passed
  G7  cert_expiry             skipped (disabled)
  G8  privacy_manifest        passed
  G9  native_module_linking   skipped (no-tool)
  G10 bundle_size             passed
```

Plus security audit findings (if any) from `${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-security.txt`:
```
  CRITICAL|hardcoded_secrets|3 match(es) — see mobile-security/hardcoded-secrets.txt
  MEDIUM|weak_crypto|1 MD5 usage — see mobile-security/weak-crypto.txt
```

```
AskUserQuestion (once, covers entire Section F):
  "Mobile gate outcomes look correct for this phase?
   (e.g. 'cert_expiry skipped because no signing yet' = OK if pre-release;
    'hardcoded_secrets=3' requires explanation before accept)

   [y] Acknowledged — outcomes match phase intent
   [n] Not OK — gate output points to an actual issue (ABORT / REJECT)
   [s] Skip — accept risk (record in UAT.md)"
```

If `n` → abort UAT, set phase verdict = REJECTED with reason `mobile-gate-review-fail`.

After all sections, present totals:
```
UAT Progress:
  Decisions (A):     {N} passed / {N} failed / {N} skipped
  Goals (B):         {N} passed / {N} failed / {N} skipped (+ {N} known gaps)
  Ripples (C):       {acknowledged | abort | accepted-risk}
  Designs (D):       {N} passed / {N} failed / {N} skipped  ({Nmob} mobile screenshots)
  Mobile gates (F):  {acknowledged | rejected | risk-accepted}  [only for mobile-*]
```

### Final verdict question
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Overall phase verdict?

   [a] ACCEPT — phase complete (all critical items pass)
   [r] REJECT — issues found, need /vg:build --gaps-only
   [d] DEFER — partial accept, revisit later (record open items)"
```

### Response persistence (OHOK Batch 3 B4 — REQUIRED for quorum gate)

**AI MUST write each AskUserQuestion response to `${PHASE_DIR}/.uat-responses.json` immediately after the user answers.** This is the source of truth read by step `5_uat_quorum_gate` below. Without persistence, the quorum gate BLOCKs (treats unset state as "user skipped everything").

Format:
```json
{
  "decisions": {"pass": 0, "fail": 0, "skip": 0, "items": [{"id": "P7.D-01", "verdict": "p|f|s", "ts": "..."}]},
  "goals": {"pass": 0, "fail": 0, "skip": 0, "items": [{"id": "G-01", "status_before": "READY", "verdict": "p|f|s", "ts": "..."}]},
  "ripples": {"verdict": "y|n|s|acknowledged|risk-accepted", "ts": "..."},
  "designs": {"pass": 0, "fail": 0, "skip": 0, "items": [{"ref": "sites-list.default", "verdict": "p|f|s", "ts": "..."}]},
  "mobile_gates": {"verdict": "y|n|s", "ts": "..."},
  "final": {"verdict": "ACCEPT|REJECT|DEFER", "ts": "..."}
}
```

AI can write/update this JSON via Bash heredoc after each section completes. Missing sections that are N/A for this profile (e.g. mobile_gates for web) should be omitted or set to `{"verdict": "n/a"}`.

```bash
mkdir -p "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers" 2>/dev/null
(type -t mark_step >/dev/null 2>&1 && mark_step "${PHASE_NUMBER:-unknown}" "5_interactive_uat" "${PHASE_DIR}") || touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/5_interactive_uat.done"
```
</step>

<step name="5_uat_quorum_gate">
**⛔ UAT QUORUM GATE (OHOK Batch 3 B4 — block theatre UAT).**

Before Batch 3 UAT was pure theatre — every AskUserQuestion offered `[s] Skip`, user could skip decisions + goals + ripples + designs all via `[s]`, phase ships with "DEFERRED" verdict, next phase reads note and proceeds. No mechanism enforced minimum due diligence.

This gate counts SKIPs on critical sections (A decisions, B READY goals) and BLOCKs if over threshold. Config-driven via `config.accept.max_uat_skips_critical` (default 0 — strict).

```bash

**Orchestrator hook:** khi step này echo `→ Invoking /vg:learn --auto-surface`, orchestrator MUST call the slash command inline so user can make y/n/e/s decisions. Non-interactive fallback: Tier B candidates stay in CANDIDATES.md for next phase's accept surface.

**v2.6 Phase C — conflict pair handler:** trong cùng prompt loop, nếu user chọn `y` cho pair (id_a vs id_b, winner=L-WIN), orchestrator MUST call:

```bash
source .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/override-debt.sh
override_auto_resolve_clean_run --target rule-retire <LOSER_ID> "winner=<WINNER_ID> conflict-resolved-at-accept"
```

Loser is whichever id ≠ winner; if winner=null (tie) and user picks `y`, prompt for a manual winner first. Mirrors override-debt auto-resolve pattern (single helper, two consumers).

### F.1 Mobile security audit findings (from /vg:test 5f_mobile_security_audit)

| Severity | Category | Summary | Evidence file |
|----------|----------|---------|---------------|
| {CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW} | {category} | {count} match(es) | mobile-security/{category}.txt |

Reviewer acknowledgment: {ACK / REJECT / RISK-ACCEPTED}

## Issues Found
{bulleted list of FAIL items across all sections, or "None"}

## Overall Summary
- Total items: {N_total}
- Passed: {N_passed}

### If ACCEPTED

**Cleanup scan intermediates** (large JSON files from review, not needed after accept):
```bash
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/scan-*.json
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/probe-*.json
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/nav-discovery.json

#       RUNTIME-MAP.json, GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md, SANDBOX-TEST.md,
#       RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md, UAT.md, .step-markers/
```

**Cleanup root-leaked screenshots** (banned location per project convention):
```bash
rm -f ./${PHASE_NUMBER}-*.png 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Prune git worktrees + playwright locks**:
```bash
git worktree prune 2>/dev/null || true
[ -x "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" ] && \
  bash "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" cleanup 0 all 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Bootstrap rule outcome attribution (Gap 3 fix):**

For each bootstrap rule that fired during this phase, emit a
`bootstrap.outcome_recorded` event so `/vg:bootstrap --efficacy` can update
`hits` + `hit_outcomes` in ACCEPTED.md. Without this, rules accumulate
`hits=0` forever even after firing — we can't prove a promoted rule is
actually affecting behavior.

```bash
# Get phase verdict (final state after UAT quorum gate)

### If REJECTED

Extract failed items from UAT.md per section into a gap list. Suggest next step:
```
Phase {PHASE_NUMBER} REJECTED — {N_failed} issues.

Failed items:
  [A] Decisions: {list of failed D-XX}
  [B] Goals:     {list of failed G-XX}
  [C] Ripples:   {if deferred}
  [D] Designs:   {list of failed refs}

Next: /vg:build ${PHASE_NUMBER} --gaps-only  (auto-creates gap-closure plans from UAT.md FAIL items)
      Then: /vg:test ${PHASE_NUMBER} → /vg:accept ${PHASE_NUMBER}
```

### If DEFERRED

```bash
# ⛔ HARD GATE (tightened 2026-04-17): DEFERRED marks phase incomplete.
# /vg:next must BLOCK until these items are resolved — previously DEFERRED silently
# allowed next phase to start, compounding tech debt.

⛔ /vg:next is BLOCKED for this phase until deferred items resolved.
   Open items recorded in UAT.md ({N_failed} FAIL items).

<success_criteria>
- All artifacts + step markers verified BEFORE UAT starts
- Checklist items generated FROM VG data (not hardcoded)
- Every D-XX, G-XX (READY), HIGH-ripple caller, design-ref addressed by user
- UAT.md written atomically with structured pass/fail/skip per section
- If ACCEPTED: cleanup + commit + state update
- If REJECTED: clear gap list pointing to /vg:build --gaps-only
- No dependency on GSD verify-work (VG-native)
- **Mobile (mobile-*) only**: Section D iterates simulator captures from
  `${PHASE_DIR}/discover/`; Section F presents gate outcomes parsed from
  `build-state.log` + security findings from `mobile-security/report.md`.
  User acknowledgment of Section F is required — rejection aborts UAT.
- **Cross-platform portability**: all paths are config-relative; no
  hardcoded device names, sim names, team IDs, or OS-specific commands.
