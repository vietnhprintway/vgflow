## Codex ⇆ Claude Code tool mapping

This skill was originally designed for Claude Code. When running in Codex CLI, translate tool calls using the table + patterns below.

### Tool mapping table

| Claude tool | Codex equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | request_user_input (free-form text, or number-prefix choices) | For multi-select, format as "1. Option / 2. Option" and parse reply |
| Task (agent spawn) | `codex exec --model <model> "<prompt>"` subprocess | Foreground: `codex exec ... > /tmp/out.txt`. Parallel: launch N subprocesses + `wait`. See "Agent spawn" below |
| TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TodoWrite | N/A — use inline markdown headers + status narration | Codex does not have a persistent task tail UI. Write `## ━━━ Phase X: step ━━━` in stdout instead |
| Monitor | Bash loop with `echo` + `sleep 3` polling | Codex streams stdout directly, no separate monitor channel |
| ScheduleWakeup | N/A — Codex is one-shot; user must re-invoke | Skill must tolerate single-execution model; no sleeping |
| WebFetch | `curl -sfL <url>` or `gh api <path>` | For GitHub URLs prefer `gh` for auth handling |
| mcp__playwright{1-5}__* | See "Playwright MCP" below | Playwright MCP tools ARE available in Codex's main orchestrator |
| mcp__graphify__* | `python -c "from graphify import ..."` inline | Graphify CLI/module works identically in Codex |
| mcp__context7__*, mcp__exa__*, mcp__firecrawl__* | Skip or fall back to WebFetch | Only available via SDK; not bundled in Codex CLI |
| Bash/Read/Write/Edit/Glob/Grep | Same — Codex supports these natively | No adapter needed |

### Agent spawn (Task → codex exec)

Claude Code spawns isolated agents via `Task(subagent_type=..., prompt=...)`. Codex equivalent:

```bash
# Single agent, foreground (wait for completion + read output)
codex exec --model gpt-5 "<full isolated prompt>" > /tmp/agent-result.txt 2>&1
RESULT=$(cat /tmp/agent-result.txt)

# Multiple agents, parallel (Claude's pattern of 1 message with N Task calls)
codex exec --model gpt-5 "<prompt 1>" > /tmp/agent-1.txt 2>&1 &
PID1=$!
codex exec --model gpt-5 "<prompt 2>" > /tmp/agent-2.txt 2>&1 &
PID2=$!
wait $PID1 $PID2
R1=$(cat /tmp/agent-1.txt); R2=$(cat /tmp/agent-2.txt)
```

**Critical constraints when spawning:**
- Subagent inherits working directory + env vars, but **no MCP server access** (Codex exec spawns fresh CLI instance without `--mcp` wired). Subagent CANNOT call `mcp__playwright*__`, `mcp__graphify__`, etc.
- Model mapping for this project: `models.planner` opus → `gpt-5`, `models.executor` sonnet → `gpt-4o`, `models.scanner` haiku → `gpt-4o-mini` (or project-configured equivalent). Check `.claude/vg.config.md` `models` section for actual values and adapt.
- Timeout: wrap in `timeout 600s codex exec ...` to prevent hung subagents.
- Return schema: if skill expects structured JSON back, prompt subagent with "Return ONLY a single JSON object with keys: {...}". Parse with `jq` or `python -c "import json,sys; ..."`.

### Playwright MCP — orchestrator-only rule

Playwright MCP tools (`mcp__playwright1__browser_navigate`, `_snapshot`, `_click`, etc.) ARE available to the main Codex orchestrator (same MCP servers as Claude Code). **BUT subagents spawned via `codex exec` do NOT inherit MCP access** — they are fresh CLI instances.

Implication for skills using Haiku scanner pattern (scanner spawns → uses Playwright):
- **Claude model:** spawn haiku agent with prompt → agent calls `mcp__playwright__` tools directly
- **Codex model:** TWO options:
  1. **Orchestrator-driven:** main orchestrator calls Playwright tools + passes snapshots/results to subagent as text → subagent returns instructions/analysis only (no tool calls). Slower but preserves parallelism benefit.
  2. **Single-agent:** orchestrator runs scanner workflow inline (no spawn). Simpler but no parallelism; suitable for 1-2 view scans but slow for 14+ views.

Default: **single-agent inline** unless skill explicitly documents the orchestrator-driven pattern for that step.

### Persistence probe (Layer 4) — execution model

For review/test skills that verify mutation persistence:
- Main orchestrator holds Playwright session (claimed via lock manager)
- Pre-snapshot + submit + refresh + re-read all run in orchestrator Playwright calls (not spawned)
- If skill delegates analysis to subagent, orchestrator must capture snapshots + pass text to subagent; subagent returns verdict JSON `{persisted: bool, pre: ..., post: ...}`

### Lock manager (Playwright)

Same as Claude:
```bash
SESSION_ID="codex-${skill}-${phase}-$$"
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER=$(bash "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" claim "$SESSION_ID")
trap "bash '${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh' release \"$SESSION_ID\" 2>/dev/null" EXIT INT TERM
```

Pool name in Codex: `codex` (separate from Claude's `claude` pool). Lock manager handles both without collision.

## Invocation

This skill is invoked by mentioning `$vg-amend`. Treat all user text after `$vg-amend` as arguments.

If argument-hint in source frontmatter is not empty and user provides no args, ask once via request_user_input before proceeding.
</codex_skill_adapter>


<rules>
1. **VG-native** — no GSD delegation. This command is self-contained.
2. **Config-driven** — read .claude/vg.config.md for project paths, profile, models.
3. **AMENDMENT-LOG is append-only** — never overwrite previous amendments, only append.
4. **CONTEXT.md patch, not regenerate** — apply surgical edits to decision list, do NOT rewrite the file.
5. **Git tag before modify** — always create a rollback tag before touching CONTEXT.md.
6. **Impact is informational** — cascade analysis warns but does NOT auto-modify PLAN.md or API-CONTRACTS.md.
</rules>

<objective>
Mid-pipeline change request handler. When requirements shift or decisions need revision during an active phase, this command:
1. Detects current pipeline step
2. Discusses changes with user
3. Writes AMENDMENT-LOG.md (append)
4. Patches CONTEXT.md decisions
5. Analyzes cascade impact on downstream artifacts
6. Tags + commits

Pipeline: specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test → accept
Amend can run at ANY point after scope.
</objective>

<process>

**Config:** Read .claude/commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md first. Use config variables ($PLANNING_DIR, $PHASES_DIR).

<step name="0_parse_and_detect">
## Step 0: Parse phase argument + detect current pipeline step

```bash
PHASE_NUMBER="$1"
PHASE_DIR="${PHASES_DIR}/${PHASE_NUMBER}-*"
# Resolve glob to actual directory
PHASE_DIR=$(ls -d ${PHASES_DIR}/${PHASE_NUMBER}-* 2>/dev/null | head -1)

if [ -z "$PHASE_DIR" ] || [ ! -d "$PHASE_DIR" ]; then
  echo "BLOCK: Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} directory not found in ${PHASES_DIR}/"
  exit 1
fi
```

Detect current step by checking which artifacts exist (ordered latest → earliest):

```bash
CURRENT_STEP="unknown"
[ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/UAT.md" ]              && CURRENT_STEP="accepted"
[ "$CURRENT_STEP" = "unknown" ] && [ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/SANDBOX-TEST.md" ]    && CURRENT_STEP="tested"
[ "$CURRENT_STEP" = "unknown" ] && [ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json" ]   && CURRENT_STEP="reviewed"
[ "$CURRENT_STEP" = "unknown" ] && [ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/SUMMARY.md" -o -f "${PHASE_DIR}/SUMMARY-wave1.md" ] && CURRENT_STEP="built"
[ "$CURRENT_STEP" = "unknown" ] && [ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/PLAN.md" ]            && CURRENT_STEP="blueprinted"
[ "$CURRENT_STEP" = "unknown" ] && [ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/CONTEXT.md" ]         && CURRENT_STEP="scoped"
[ "$CURRENT_STEP" = "unknown" ] && [ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/SPECS.md" ]           && CURRENT_STEP="specced"
```

Validate: CONTEXT.md MUST exist (amend modifies decisions — no decisions = nothing to amend).
Missing → BLOCK: "Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} has no CONTEXT.md. Run `/vg:scope ${PHASE_NUMBER}` first."

Display: `"Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} — current step: ${CURRENT_STEP}"`

Count existing amendments:
```bash
AMENDMENT_COUNT=0
if [ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/AMENDMENT-LOG.md" ]; then
  AMENDMENT_COUNT=$(grep -c '^## Amendment #' "${PHASE_DIR}/AMENDMENT-LOG.md" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
fi
NEXT_AMENDMENT=$((AMENDMENT_COUNT + 1))
```
</step>

<step name="1_change_type">
## Step 1: What to change?

```
AskUserQuestion:
  header: "Amendment #${NEXT_AMENDMENT} — Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} (step: ${CURRENT_STEP})"
  question: "What kind of change?"
  options:
    - "Add feature/endpoint" — new functionality not in original scope
    - "Modify decision" — change an existing D-XX decision
    - "Remove feature" — descope something (defer to later phase or drop)
    - "Change technical approach" — different implementation for same goal
```

Store: `$CHANGE_TYPE` = selected option.
</step>

<step name="2_discussion">
## Step 2: Discuss change details

Read current CONTEXT.md → extract all D-XX decisions into memory.

```
AskUserQuestion:
  header: "Change Details"
  question: "Describe the change. I'll show which decisions (D-XX) are affected."
  (open text)
```

AI analyzes user's description against existing decisions:
- List D-XX decisions that this change touches (show current text)
- Identify new decisions needed (propose D-XX IDs continuing from max)
- Identify decisions to remove/defer (show what will be dropped)
- Flag any contradictions with remaining decisions

Present summary:
```
Amendment #${NEXT_AMENDMENT} impact on decisions:
  MODIFY: D-05 — was: "Use MongoDB aggregation for reports" → proposed: "Use ClickHouse for reports"
  ADD:    D-12 — "Add /api/reports/export endpoint for CSV download"
  REMOVE: D-08 — "Client-side PDF generation" (deferred to phase {X})
  
Confirm these changes?
```

```
AskUserQuestion:
  header: "Confirm"
  question: "Proceed with these decision changes?"
  options:
    - "Yes — apply changes"
    - "Adjust — let me modify"
    - "Cancel — abort amendment"
```

If "Adjust" → loop back to discussion.
If "Cancel" → exit without changes.
</step>

<step name="3_write_amendment_log">
## Step 3: Write AMENDMENT-LOG.md (APPEND)

If file does not exist, create with header:
```markdown
# Amendment Log — Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER}

Append-only record of mid-phase changes. Each amendment references decisions modified in CONTEXT.md.
```

Append new amendment block:

```markdown

---

## Amendment #${NEXT_AMENDMENT} — ${ISO_DATE}

**Trigger:** ${user_description}
**Phase step at time of amendment:** ${CURRENT_STEP}
**Change type:** ${CHANGE_TYPE}

**Changes:**
- ${CHANGE_TYPE === "modify" ? "D-XX updated: was \"${old_text}\" → now \"${new_text}\"" : ""}
- ${CHANGE_TYPE === "add" ? "Added: D-XX \"${new_decision}\"" : ""}
- ${CHANGE_TYPE === "remove" ? "Removed: D-XX \"${removed}\" (deferred to phase ${X})" : ""}

**Impact analysis:**
- PLAN.md: ${has_plan ? "tasks ${affected_task_nums} affected (touch ${affected_files})" : "not yet created"}
- API-CONTRACTS.md: ${has_contracts ? "${N} endpoints added/modified/removed" : "not yet created"}
- TEST-GOALS.md: ${has_goals ? "${N} goals added/invalidated" : "not yet created"}
- Code (SUMMARY): ${has_summary ? "gap-closure build may be needed" : "no code yet"}

**Rollback point:** `git tag vg-amend-${PHASE_NUMBER}-pre-${NEXT_AMENDMENT}`
```
</step>

<step name="4_update_context">
## Step 4: Update CONTEXT.md

**Patch, do NOT regenerate.**

For each change:
- **Modify D-XX**: Edit the specific line in CONTEXT.md, preserve surrounding decisions
- **Add D-XX**: Append new decision at end of decisions section, use next available ID
- **Remove D-XX**: Strike through with reason: `~~D-XX: {text}~~ (removed — amendment #${NEXT_AMENDMENT}, deferred to phase {X})`

Add amendment reference footer at bottom of CONTEXT.md (append, do not overwrite existing footers):

```markdown

---
_Amendment #${NEXT_AMENDMENT} applied ${ISO_DATE} — see AMENDMENT-LOG.md_
```
</step>

<step name="5_cascade_impact">
## Step 5: Cascade impact analysis

Check which downstream artifacts exist and report impact:

**If PLAN.md exists:**
- Read PLAN.md → find tasks that reference modified/removed D-XX decisions
- **Matching algorithm** (deterministic, 3 strategies — union of all matches):
  1. Grep PLAN.md for `<goals-covered>` tags containing D-XX references (e.g., `<goals-covered>G-03 (D-05)</goals-covered>`)
  2. Grep PLAN.md for task descriptions mentioning the decision text or keywords from the changed D-XX
  3. Grep PLAN.md for `<contract-ref>` tags if the changed decision has endpoints — match endpoint paths (e.g., `POST /api/sites`)
- Affected tasks = union of all matches from strategies 1-3
- List affected task numbers and file paths they touch
- Display: "PLAN.md: tasks {N-M} reference changed decisions. Re-plan recommended."

**If API-CONTRACTS.md exists:**
- Read API-CONTRACTS.md → find endpoints that map to changed decisions
- List added/removed/modified endpoints
- Display: "API-CONTRACTS.md: {N} endpoints affected."

**If TEST-GOALS.md exists:**
- Read TEST-GOALS.md → find goals that trace to changed decisions
- Flag goals that are now invalid or need new goals added
- Display: "TEST-GOALS.md: {N} goals invalidated, {M} new goals needed."

**If SUMMARY*.md exists (code built):**
- Warn: "Code has been built. Changes may require gap-closure build."
- Display: "Run `/vg:build ${PHASE_NUMBER} --gaps-only` to build missing pieces."

**If RUNTIME-MAP.json exists (reviewed):**
- Warn: "Review completed. Re-review recommended after code changes."

**Suggest next action based on current step:**

| Current Step | Suggested Next |
|---|---|
| scoped | `/vg:blueprint ${PHASE_NUMBER}` — plan will incorporate amendments |
| blueprinted | `/vg:blueprint ${PHASE_NUMBER} --from=2a` — re-plan affected tasks |
| built | `/vg:build ${PHASE_NUMBER} --gaps-only` — build only new/changed parts |
| reviewed | `/vg:build ${PHASE_NUMBER} --gaps-only` then `/vg:review ${PHASE_NUMBER} --retry-failed` |
| tested | `/vg:build ${PHASE_NUMBER} --gaps-only` then `/vg:review ${PHASE_NUMBER}` (full re-review) |
| accepted | Warning: phase already accepted. Consider opening a new phase instead. |
</step>

<step name="6_git_tag_and_commit">
## Step 6: Git tag + commit

```bash
# Create rollback tag BEFORE committing changes
git tag "vg-amend-${PHASE_NUMBER}-pre-${NEXT_AMENDMENT}" HEAD

# Stage amended files
git add "${PHASE_DIR}/CONTEXT.md" "${PHASE_DIR}/AMENDMENT-LOG.md"

# Commit
git commit -m "amend(${PHASE_NUMBER}): ${CHANGE_TYPE} — ${short_summary}

Amendment #${NEXT_AMENDMENT}: ${user_description_short}
Decisions changed: ${changed_decision_ids}
Rollback: git checkout vg-amend-${PHASE_NUMBER}-pre-${NEXT_AMENDMENT}

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

Display:
```
Amendment #${NEXT_AMENDMENT} applied to Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER}
  Type: ${CHANGE_TYPE}
  Decisions modified: ${list}
  Rollback tag: vg-amend-${PHASE_NUMBER}-pre-${NEXT_AMENDMENT}
  
  Suggested next: ${suggested_action}
```
</step>

</process>

<success_criteria>
- AMENDMENT-LOG.md exists with new amendment block appended (never overwrites previous)
- CONTEXT.md patched with decision changes (not regenerated)
- Git tag created before changes for rollback safety
- Cascade impact displayed for all existing downstream artifacts
- Commit message references amendment number and changed decisions
- Clear next-action guidance based on current pipeline step
