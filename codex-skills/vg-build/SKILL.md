## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Do NOT blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-build`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.

<NARRATION_POLICY>
**⛔ DO NOT USE TodoWrite / TaskCreate / TaskUpdate in this command.**

Why: those tools persist items in Claude Code's status tail across sessions. Wave-based parallel build can spawn 5+ subagents running 10-30 min each — items hang in UI for runs after if interrupted.

**Use these instead:**
1. **Markdown headers in YOUR text output** between tool calls — e.g., `## ━━━ Wave 2 / Task 7.6-04 ━━━`. Appears in message stream, does NOT persist after session ends.
2. **`run_in_background: true` for any Bash > 30s** (typecheck, lint, tests), then poll with `BashOutput` so user sees stdout live.
3. **For Task subagents > 2 min**: write 1-line status BEFORE spawning ("Wave 2 spawning 5 parallel executors for tasks 04-08...") + 1-line summary AFTER ("Wave 2 done: 5/5 commits, typecheck PASS").
4. Bash echo narration is audit log only — not user-visible during long runs.
5. **Translate English terms (RULE)** — output có thuật ngữ tiếng Anh PHẢI thêm giải thích VN trong dấu ngoặc tại lần đầu xuất hiện. Tham khảo `_shared/term-glossary.md`. Ví dụ: `Wave (đợt)`, `commit (lưu thay đổi)`, `typecheck (kiểm tra kiểu)`, `BLOCK (chặn)`. Không áp dụng: file path, code identifier, config tag values, lần lặp lại trong cùng message.
</NARRATION_POLICY>

<rules>
1. **Blueprint required** — phase must have PLAN*.md AND API-CONTRACTS.md before build. Missing = BLOCK.
2. **Contract injection + runtime verification** — every executor agent receives relevant contract sections as context. At run-complete, orchestrator dispatches `verify-contract-runtime` validator: for each `## METHOD /path` endpoint declared in API-CONTRACTS.md, static presence check across framework patterns (fastify / express / nest / hono); missing routes → BLOCK. Catches phantom endpoints at wave-commit boundary instead of surfacing at review/test 1+ hour later (OHOK A2, v2.4).
3. **Orchestrator coordinates, not executes** — discover plans, group waves, spawn agents, collect results.
4. **Context budget per agent ~2000 lines** — each executor gets scoped context blocks (task/API contract/CRUD surface/goals/design/sibling/wave/execution). Modern Claude 200k comfortable; starving context causes drift. See step 8c for per-block line budgets.
5. **Wave execution** — sequential between waves, parallel within.
6. **Flags are opt-in** — only active when literal token appears in $ARGUMENTS.
7. **Profile enforcement (UNIVERSAL)** — every `<step>` MUST, as its FINAL action, run:
   `touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/{STEP_NAME}.done"`
   where `{STEP_NAME}` matches the `<step name="...">` attribute. Step 9 verifies all expected markers exist; missing marker = BLOCK. This is deterministic enforcement — AI cannot silently skip a step without leaving forensic evidence.
8. **Bash vs MCP convention**:
   - ` ```bash ` blocks = REAL bash commands. Run via Bash tool. Outputs to shell variables for use in next step.
   - **MCP tool calls** (`mcp__graphify__*`, `mcp__playwright*__*`, etc.) = Claude tool invocations. NEVER call from bash — invoke directly via tool use. Required tool name is in prose; arguments listed as bullet points.
   - Confusing the two = silent fall-back to grep path / lost graphify benefit. When a step has BOTH (compute vars in bash → call MCP tool → parse result), the prose explicitly separates them with "(in bash)" vs "(Claude tool call)" labels.
</rules>

<objective>
Step 3 of V5 pipeline. Execute code based on blueprint (plans + API contracts).

Pipeline: specs → scope → blueprint → **build** → review → test → accept

Key difference from V4 execute: executors read API-CONTRACTS.md to ensure BE routes match contract fields and FE calls match contract endpoints.
</objective>

**Config:** Read .claude/commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md first.

**Bug detection (v1.11.2 R6 — MANDATORY):** Read `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/bug-detection-guide.md` BEFORE starting. Apply 6 detection patterns throughout: schema_violation, helper_error, user_pushback, ai_inconsistency, gate_loop, self_discovery. When detected: NARRATE intent + CALL `report_bug` via bash + CONTINUE workflow (non-blocking).

<step name="0_gate_integrity_precheck">
**T8 gate (cổng) integrity precheck — blocks build if /vg:update left unresolved gate conflicts (xung đột).**

If `${PLANNING_DIR}/vgflow-patches/gate-conflicts.md` exists, a prior `/vg:update` detected that the 3-way merge (gộp) altered one or more HARD gate blocks. Until a human resolves them via `/vg:reapply-patches --verify-gates`, the pipeline cannot trust its own enforcement logic — so we BLOCK (chặn).

- Optional `--only 15,16,17` — resume specific tasks only (skip others). Use
  after partial Wave completion (crash, compact, manual kill) to re-run only
  the tasks that didn't commit. Reads `.build-progress.json` to verify.
- Optional `--status` — read-only: print `.build-progress.json` + exit. Safe
  to call after compact to see where we are. No state changes.
- Optional `--gaps-only`, `--interactive`, `--auto`
- Optional `--reset-queue` — wipe `.vg/.build-queue/` + unstage leftover files
  from a crashed prior run, then proceed. Use after SIGKILL / OS crash where
  the commit-queue mutex's EXIT trap didn't fire. Safe on clean state (no-op).

## Step 1a — Build queue preflight (crash recovery)

Run BEFORE wave-start tagging to detect leftover state from prior crashed
runs. Catches 4 failure modes:

1. Stale commit-queue lock (mutex EXIT trap didn't fire on SIGKILL/crash)
2. Active commit-queue lock (another /vg:build running on same repo)
3. Staged-but-uncommitted files (would leak into wave-start baseline → every
   subsequent wave commit looks like it's over-claiming those files →
   attribution audit would flag the whole wave)
4. Unresolved merge conflicts (cannot build on conflicted tree)

```bash
source "${REPO_ROOT:-.}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/build-queue-preflight.sh"

if ! vg_build_queue_preflight "$RESET_QUEUE" "$PHASE_ARG"; then
  echo ""
  echo "   Preflight gate blocks until state is clean."
  echo "   Quick fix: /vg:build ${PHASE_ARG} --reset-queue"

```

The preflight helper:
- With `--reset-queue=true`: wipes `.vg/.build-queue/` + `git reset HEAD -- .`
  (working tree untouched — only unstages)
- Auto-breaks stale locks older than `VG_COMMIT_LOCK_STALE_SECONDS` (default 600s)
- Blocks on active lock < threshold, staged files, or merge conflicts
- Prints concrete fix options for each blocker

**Create sub-step task list for progress tracking — with profile-filter enforcement.**

### Step 0: Profile preflight (deterministic, bash)

import re, sys
for line in open('.claude/vg.config.md', encoding='utf-8'):
    m = re.match(r'^profile:\s*[\"\']?([^\"\'#\s]+)', line)

fi

# Compute expected applicable steps for this profile
EXPECTED_STEPS=$(${PYTHON_BIN} .claude/scripts/filter-steps.py \
  --command .claude/commands/vg/build.md \
  --profile "$PROFILE" \
  --output-ids)
EXPECTED_COUNT=$(echo "$EXPECTED_STEPS" | tr ',' '\n' | wc -l)

echo "Profile: $PROFILE"
echo "Expected steps ($EXPECTED_COUNT): $EXPECTED_STEPS"

# Marker directory for post-execution verify
MARKER_DIR="${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers"
mkdir -p "$MARKER_DIR"
if [[ ! "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --resume ]]; then
  rm -f "$MARKER_DIR"/*.done 2>/dev/null  # fresh run only
  echo "Fresh build — cleared markers."
else
  EXISTING_MARKERS=$(ls "$MARKER_DIR"/*.done 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
  echo "Resume build — keeping ${EXISTING_MARKERS} existing markers."
fi
```

### Step 1: Narrate step plan (NO TaskCreate — see NARRATION_POLICY above)

Per NARRATION_POLICY (`⛔ DO NOT USE TodoWrite / TaskCreate / TaskUpdate`), progress tracking in /vg:build uses `.step-markers/*.done` files as the authoritative signal, NOT a task list. Before proceeding:

1. Write a markdown header in your text output listing the expected step plan:
   ```
   ## ━━━ /vg:build step plan (profile=$PROFILE, $EXPECTED_COUNT steps) ━━━
   - ${stepId_1}
   - ${stepId_2}
   - ...
   ```
2. Run each step in order. At start: write `## ━━━ Running ${stepId} ━━━` header. At end: `touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/${stepId}.done"`.

### Step 2: Marker directory sanity check (replaces task count assertion)

Confirm marker dir is empty on fresh build (or populated as expected on resume):
```bash
EXISTING_COUNT=$(ls "$MARKER_DIR"/*.done 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
if [[ ! "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --resume ]] && [ "$EXISTING_COUNT" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "⛔ Fresh build but ${EXISTING_COUNT} stale markers in ${MARKER_DIR}. Run with --reset-queue or manually clean."
  exit 1
fi
echo "▸ Step plan: $EXPECTED_COUNT steps for profile=$PROFILE. Progress tracked via ${MARKER_DIR}/*.done."
```

**Rule for subsequent steps:** every `<step>` body MUST, as its FINAL action, write a marker:
```bash
touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/{STEP_NAME}.done"
```
Post-execution check (step 9) compares markers vs EXPECTED_STEPS. Missing marker = step skipped silently = BLOCK.

**MANDATORY GATE — blueprint artifacts + CONTEXT.md format.**

### 3a: Check core artifacts exist

```bash
PLANS=$(ls "${PHASE_DIR}"/PLAN*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
CONTRACTS=$(ls "${PHASE_DIR}"/API-CONTRACTS.md 2>/dev/null)
```

Missing PLAN → BLOCK: "Run `/vg:blueprint {phase}` first."
Missing CONTRACTS → WARNING: "No API contracts. Executors will build without contract guidance. Continue? (y/n)"

### 3b: CONTEXT.md format validation (v1.14.4+ — R2 enforcement)

Executor rules require commits cite `D-XX` / `P{phase}.D-XX` decisions. If CONTEXT.md missing or legacy format (no Endpoints / Test Scenarios sub-sections), executor cites stale decisions and commit-msg hook either fails or lets weak citations through.

```bash
# Only enforce for feature profile — other profiles (infra/hotfix/docs) skip CONTEXT per phase-profile rules
PHASE_PROFILE_FOR_CTX="${PHASE_PROFILE:-feature}"
if [ "$PHASE_PROFILE_FOR_CTX" = "feature" ]; then
  CONTEXT_FILE="${PHASE_DIR}/CONTEXT.md"

  if [ ! -f "$CONTEXT_FILE" ]; then
    echo "⛔ CONTEXT.md missing cho phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} (feature profile cần CONTEXT.md)."
    echo "   Run: /vg:scope ${PHASE_NUMBER} trước khi build."
    exit 1
  fi

  # Parse CONTEXT structure
  DECISION_COUNT=$(grep -cE '^### (P[0-9.]+\.)?D-[0-9]+' "$CONTEXT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  ENDPOINT_SECTIONS=$(grep -c '^\*\*Endpoints:\*\*' "$CONTEXT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
  TEST_SECTIONS=$(grep -c '^\*\*Test Scenarios:\*\*' "$CONTEXT_FILE" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)

  if [ "$DECISION_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "⛔ CONTEXT.md có 0 decisions — phase chưa scoped đúng."
    echo "   Expected: '### D-01', '### D-02', ... hoặc '### P${PHASE_NUMBER}.D-01' format."
    echo "   Run: /vg:scope ${PHASE_NUMBER}"
    exit 1
  fi

  if [ "$ENDPOINT_SECTIONS" -eq 0 ] && [ "$TEST_SECTIONS" -eq 0 ]; then
    # Legacy format — warn but allow (blueprint step 2a also warns)
    echo "⚠ CONTEXT.md legacy format (không có 'Endpoints:' hoặc 'Test Scenarios:' sub-sections)."
    echo "   Executor sẽ cite decision IDs nhưng thiếu context cụ thể."
    echo "   Khuyến nghị: /vg:scope ${PHASE_NUMBER} để re-enrich."
    # Log to override-debt (technical debt tracking)
    if type -t log_override_debt >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      log_override_debt "build-context-legacy" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" "CONTEXT.md legacy format — no Endpoints/Test sections" "$PHASE_DIR"
    fi
  fi

  echo "✓ CONTEXT.md: ${DECISION_COUNT} decisions, ${ENDPOINT_SECTIONS} endpoint blocks, ${TEST_SECTIONS} test blocks"
fi
```

Result routing:
- Feature profile + CONTEXT.md missing → HARD BLOCK
- Feature profile + 0 decisions → HARD BLOCK
- Feature profile + legacy format → WARN + log override-debt
- Non-feature profile → skip check (CONTEXT.md not required)

### 3c: Amendment freshness check (harness v2.7-fixup-C1)

**Why:** `/vg:amend` writes `AMENDMENT-LOG.md` mid-phase. If user runs amend AFTER blueprint but BEFORE build, PLAN.md / API-CONTRACTS.md are stale relative to the amendment. Build would silently execute the pre-amendment plan. This gate detects mtime drift and blocks unless user explicitly overrides.

```bash
# C1 fix — Amendment freshness check
# Detect /vg:amend ran between blueprint and build → BLOCK with re-blueprint guidance.
AMENDMENT_FILE="${PHASE_DIR}/AMENDMENT-LOG.md"
if [ -f "$AMENDMENT_FILE" ]; then
  PLAN_FILE="${PHASE_DIR}/PLAN.md"
  CONTRACTS_FILE="${PHASE_DIR}/API-CONTRACTS.md"
  STALE=""
  if [ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ] && [ "$AMENDMENT_FILE" -nt "$PLAN_FILE" ]; then
    STALE="PLAN.md"
  fi
  if [ -f "$CONTRACTS_FILE" ] && [ "$AMENDMENT_FILE" -nt "$CONTRACTS_FILE" ]; then
    STALE="${STALE:+$STALE+}API-CONTRACTS.md"
  fi
  if [ -n "$STALE" ]; then
    echo "⛔ Amendment freshness BLOCK — AMENDMENT-LOG.md is newer than $STALE"
    echo "   Mid-phase amendment landed after last blueprint pass."
    echo "   Re-run: /vg:blueprint ${PHASE_NUMBER} --from=2a"
    echo "   (or override via --override-reason if amendment is doc-only)"
    if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --override-reason ]]; then
      exit 1
    fi
    type -t log_override_debt >/dev/null 2>&1 && \
      log_override_debt "amendment-stale-blueprint" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
        "amendment newer than blueprint; user override" "$PHASE_DIR"
    echo "⚠ --override-reason set — proceeding with stale plan, debt logged"
  fi
fi
```

Result routing:
- AMENDMENT-LOG.md absent → skip (no mid-phase change)
- AMENDMENT newer than PLAN/CONTRACTS + no --override-reason → HARD BLOCK
- AMENDMENT newer + --override-reason set → WARN + log override-debt
- AMENDMENT older than PLAN/CONTRACTS → PASS (blueprint already incorporated changes)

### 3d: CONTEXT.md freshness vs PLAN.md (harness v2.7-fixup-M4)

**Why:** Step 3b validates CONTEXT.md format + decision count, but does NOT detect when user manually edits CONTEXT.md after blueprint completed. Mid-phase decision tweak (e.g., adding D-15 directly to CONTEXT.md without /vg:amend) leaves PLAN.md stale referencing the pre-edit decision set. Build executes against an inconsistent decision graph. This gate compares mtimes and forces a re-blueprint or explicit override.

```bash
# M4 fix — CONTEXT.md mtime freshness check
# Detects post-blueprint edits to CONTEXT.md → BLOCK with re-blueprint or /vg:amend guidance.
if [ "$PHASE_PROFILE_FOR_CTX" = "feature" ] && [ -f "$CONTEXT_FILE" ]; then
  PLAN_FILE="${PHASE_DIR}/PLAN.md"
  if [ -f "$PLAN_FILE" ] && [ "$CONTEXT_FILE" -nt "$PLAN_FILE" ]; then
    echo "⛔ CONTEXT.md modified after PLAN.md — re-blueprint or run /vg:amend"
    echo "   PLAN.md is stale relative to current CONTEXT.md decisions."
    echo "   Run: /vg:blueprint ${PHASE_NUMBER} --from=2a   (re-plan from current CONTEXT)"
    echo "   OR:  /vg:amend ${PHASE_NUMBER}                  (capture change as amendment)"
    echo "   Override (NOT RECOMMENDED): re-run with --override-reason=\"...\""
    if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --override-reason ]]; then
      exit 1
    fi
    type -t log_override_debt >/dev/null 2>&1 && \
      log_override_debt "context-stale-plan" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
        "CONTEXT newer than PLAN; user override" "$PHASE_DIR"
    echo "⚠ --override-reason set — proceeding with stale plan, debt logged"
  fi
fi
```

Result routing:
- CONTEXT.md older than PLAN.md → PASS (blueprint incorporated current decisions)
- CONTEXT.md newer + no --override-reason → HARD BLOCK
- CONTEXT.md newer + --override-reason set → WARN + log override-debt
- Non-feature profile → skip (CONTEXT.md not required)

<step name="4_load_contracts_and_context">
**Load artifacts + resolve all context-injection variables BEFORE spawning executors.**

**Resume-safe:** This step MUST run even on `--resume` if its artifacts are missing.
Prior builds may have lacked graphify context — new build needs step 4 data.

### 4_pre: Graphify + cross-platform vars

Already resolved by `_shared/config-loader.md` helpers at command start. Available:
- `$PYTHON_BIN` — Python 3.10+ interpreter (validated)
- `$REPO_ROOT` — absolute repo root (git toplevel)
- `$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH` — absolute graph path (resolved from config)
- `$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE` — "true" if enabled + graph exists
- `$VG_TMP` — cross-platform temp dir

Steps 4c, 4e, 8c read these vars. No duplicate parsing here.

**Graphify auto-rebuild (stale check):**

```bash
if [ "${GRAPHIFY_ENABLED:-false}" = "true" ]; then
  # Source graphify-safe helper (verifies mtime advances post-rebuild, retries once on stuck)
  source "${REPO_ROOT}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/graphify-safe.sh"

  if [ ! -f "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Graphify: enabled but graph missing — cold-building before executor context"
    if vg_graphify_rebuild_safe "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" "build-step4-cold"; then
      GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE="true"
    elif [ "${GRAPHIFY_FALLBACK:-true}" = "false" ]; then
      echo "⛔ Graphify cold build failed and fallback_to_grep=false"
      exit 1
    else
      echo "⚠ Graphify cold build failed; step 4 will use grep fallback"
    fi
  fi

  if [ "$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE" = "true" ]; then
    GRAPH_BUILD_EPOCH=$(stat -c %Y "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" 2>/dev/null || stat -f %m "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" 2>/dev/null)
    COMMITS_SINCE=$(git log --since="@${GRAPH_BUILD_EPOCH}" --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

    if [ "${COMMITS_SINCE:-0}" -gt 0 ]; then
      echo "Graphify: ${COMMITS_SINCE} commits since last build — rebuilding for fresh context"
      vg_graphify_rebuild_safe "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" "build-step4" || {
        if [ "${GRAPHIFY_FALLBACK:-true}" = "false" ]; then
          echo "⛔ Graphify rebuild failed and fallback_to_grep=false"
          exit 1
        fi
        echo "⚠ Graphify rebuild did not complete successfully; downstream sibling/caller context may be stale"
      }
    else
      echo "Graphify: up to date (0 commits since last build)"
    fi
  fi
fi
```

**Why always rebuild before build:** Graph is consumed by step 4c (siblings) and 4e (callers). Stale graph = wrong sibling suggestions = executor copies wrong patterns. Rebuild is fast (~10s for incremental) and runs once per build — cheap insurance vs debugging wrong sibling context.

### 4_pre_b: Read pre-build CrossAI verdict (harness v2.7-fixup-M6)

**Why:** Blueprint step 2d-6 emits `${PHASE_DIR}/crossai/result-blueprint-review*.xml`
(MUST_WRITE per blueprint frontmatter). Build's own CrossAI loop (step 11) writes
into a SEPARATE directory and has zero awareness of the pre-build verdict. If the
blueprint pass flagged unresolved major/critical issues that minor auto-fix didn't
land, the executor is unaware of them. Surface that verdict here so the operator
sees continuity across blueprint→build, and downstream prompts can tag the warning.

```bash
# M6 fix — surface blueprint-review CrossAI verdict + unresolved flag count
BLUEPRINT_CROSSAI_DIR="${PHASE_DIR}/crossai"
if [ -d "$BLUEPRINT_CROSSAI_DIR" ]; then
  # shellcheck disable=SC2086
  RESULT_XMLS=$(ls "$BLUEPRINT_CROSSAI_DIR"/result-blueprint-review*.xml 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$RESULT_XMLS" ]; then
    # shellcheck disable=SC2086
    BLUEPRINT_VERDICT=$(grep -h -oP '<verdict>\K[^<]+' $RESULT_XMLS 2>/dev/null \
      | sort -u | head -3 | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')
    # shellcheck disable=SC2086
    BLUEPRINT_FLAGS=$(grep -ch 'severity="major"\|severity="critical"' $RESULT_XMLS 2>/dev/null \
      | awk '{s+=$1} END{print s+0}')
    echo "📋 Blueprint CrossAI verdict: ${BLUEPRINT_VERDICT:-none} (${BLUEPRINT_FLAGS} unresolved major/critical)"
    # Surface to executor — appended to TASK_CONTEXT later if non-empty
    export VG_BLUEPRINT_CROSSAI_SUMMARY="verdict=${BLUEPRINT_VERDICT:-none} unresolved=${BLUEPRINT_FLAGS}"
  else
    echo "📋 Blueprint CrossAI: no result-blueprint-review*.xml found (skip-crossai or pre-2d phase)"
  fi
fi
```

Result routing:
- result-blueprint-review*.xml present → log verdict + unresolved count, export VG_BLUEPRINT_CROSSAI_SUMMARY
- No XMLs (skip-crossai run, or older phases without blueprint CrossAI) → silent skip
- Verdict==BLOCK with unresolved>0 → not auto-blocked here (build proceeds), but surfaced loudly so operator can abort

### 4a: Contract context

Read `${PHASE_DIR}/API-CONTRACTS.md`. Per plan task, extract only endpoint sections the task touches (grep for endpoint paths task mentions).

### 4b: Design context paths (fixes G4)

DESIGN_OUTPUT_DIR=$(vg_config_get design_assets.output_dir "${PLANNING_DIR}/design-normalized")  # OHOK-9 round-4

# v2.30+ design resolver gate. This is the active path: build uses the same

### 4c: Sibling module detection — hybrid script (graphify + filesystem + git)

**Why script not MCP**: graphify's AST extractor doesn't resolve path aliases (e.g., TS `@/hooks/useAuth` → `src/hooks/useAuth`). Pure MCP query misses alias-imported relationships → wrong community → wrong siblings. The hybrid script (`find-siblings.py`) combines filesystem walk (alias-independent) + git activity + graphify community signal (optional) for accurate peer detection on any stack.

**Run `find-siblings.py` for each task with file-path:**

OHOK Batch 4 B7 (2026-04-22): subprocess failure now exits build. Previously
script failure was silent — executor got empty sibling context without
orchestrator knowing.

```bash
mkdir -p "${PHASE_DIR}/.wave-context"

SIBLINGS_FAILED=()
for task in "${WAVE_TASKS[@]}"; do
  # task iteration gives TASK_NUM + TASK_FILE_PATH
  SIBLING_OUT="${PHASE_DIR}/.wave-context/siblings-task-${TASK_NUM}.json"

  GRAPHIFY_FLAG=""
  if [ "$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE" = "true" ]; then
    GRAPHIFY_FLAG="--graphify-graph $GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH"
  fi

  if ! ${PYTHON_BIN} .claude/scripts/find-siblings.py \
       --file "$TASK_FILE_PATH" \
       --config .claude/vg.config.md \
       --top-n 3 \
       $GRAPHIFY_FLAG \
       --output "$SIBLING_OUT" 2>&1; then
    # Non-fatal per-task — new modules legitimately have no siblings.
    # But track + emit telemetry so pattern surfacing on a whole wave triggers review.
    SIBLINGS_FAILED+=("${TASK_NUM}:${TASK_FILE_PATH}")
    # Write stub so downstream 8c doesn't crash on missing JSON
    echo '{"siblings":[],"source":"find-siblings-failed"}' > "$SIBLING_OUT"
  fi
done

# If ALL tasks failed, something is systemically wrong — BLOCK.
if [ "${#SIBLINGS_FAILED[@]}" -gt 0 ] && \
   [ "${#SIBLINGS_FAILED[@]}" -eq "${#WAVE_TASKS[@]}" ]; then
  echo "⛔ find-siblings.py failed for ALL ${#WAVE_TASKS[@]} tasks in wave — systemic issue" >&2
  echo "   Failures: ${SIBLINGS_FAILED[@]}" >&2
  echo "   Check: (a) find-siblings.py exists + executable, (b) config valid," >&2
  echo "          (c) graphify graph path correct if GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE=true" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### Output format (`.wave-context/siblings-task-{N}.json`)

Step 8c reads this file when assembling the `<sibling_context>` executor prompt block. Format (~15-20 lines vs ~100 grep dump):

```
// <module_dir> (sibling — entry: <entry_file>)
<kind> <name>                  [L<line>]
// <module_dir> (sibling)
<kind> <name>                  [L<line>]
```

### Fallback behavior

If script exits non-zero OR `siblings` list is empty → orchestrator injects `<sibling_context>NONE — no peer modules at this directory level</sibling_context>` (correct signal for "first module in new architectural area", not an error).

**No MCP**: script is deterministic and alias-independent — works on any project regardless of TS path aliases, Python sys.path tweaks, or custom module resolution.

### 4d: Task section extraction (fixes G6)

For each task in PLAN*.md, pre-extract its section into a temp file so executor gets only that task, not the entire plan:

```bash
TASKS_DIR="${PHASE_DIR}/.wave-tasks"
mkdir -p "$TASKS_DIR"

# Parse PLAN*.md, split by task headings (h2 or h3 — VG-native uses ### under wave headings)
awk '
  /^#{2,3} Task [0-9]+/ { if (out) close(out); n=$3; gsub(":", "", n); out="'$TASKS_DIR'/task-" n ".md"; print > out; next }
  out { print >> out }
' "${PHASE_DIR}"/PLAN*.md
```

Each executor now injects `@${TASKS_DIR}/task-{N}.md` (task-only, ~100-300 lines) instead of `@${PLAN_FILE}` (full file).

### 4e: Caller graph load (semantic regression) — dispatch by graphify

Build or refresh `.callers.json` — maps each task's `<edits-*>` symbols to downstream callers across the repo. Executors read this to update or cite callers when changing shared symbols.

Output schema is identical regardless of source (graphify vs grep) — commit-msg hook reads same fields. Add `source: "graphify" | "grep"` field for traceability.

```bash
if [ "$(vg_config_get semantic_regression.enabled true)" = "true" ]; then  # OHOK-9 round-4
  CALLER_GRAPH="${PHASE_DIR}/.callers.json"

  # Regenerate if missing OR any PLAN*.md newer than graph
  NEEDS_REGEN=false

**⚠ WAVE_FILTER gate (v2.2):** If `WAVE_FILTER` is set (from `--wave N`), execute **ONLY** that wave. After Wave N completes + commits successfully, skip all subsequent waves and proceed directly to step 9_post_execution. Use for incremental testing on large phases (8+ waves).

```bash
if [ -n "${WAVE_FILTER:-}" ]; then
  echo "▸ --wave ${WAVE_FILTER} mode: orchestrator will execute ONLY Wave ${WAVE_FILTER} then exit to step 9."
fi
```

For each wave (subject to WAVE_FILTER gate above):

### 8a: Generate wave-context.md (BEFORE spawning executors)

Orchestrator writes `${PHASE_DIR}/wave-{N}-context.md` listing siblings. Each executor in wave reads this for cross-task field alignment.

```markdown
# Wave {N} Context — Phase {PHASE}

Tasks running in parallel this wave:

## Task <N1> — <task title from PLAN>
  File: <task.file_path>
  Endpoint: <method + path>           (if BE task — from <edits-endpoint> attribute)
  Request fields: <field list>         (from contract section)
  Response fields: <field list>
  Contract ref: API-CONTRACTS.md line <start>-<end>

## Task <N2> — <task title>
  File: <task.file_path>
  Consumes: <upstream endpoint> (Task <N1>)         (if FE task consuming a wave-mate's API)
  MUST use same field names as Task <N1> request
  Contract ref: API-CONTRACTS.md line <start>-<end>

## Task <N3> — <task title>
  File: <task.file_path>
  Shares <storage backend> collection/table with Task <N1>    (if relevant)
  Contract ref: API-CONTRACTS.md line <start>-<end>
```

Generated deterministically from PLAN*.md tasks (parse `<file-path>`, `<edits-endpoint>`, `<contract-ref>`, `<edits-collection>` attributes — no project hardcode).

### 8a.5: Initialize SUMMARY.md (first wave only)

```bash
SUMMARY_FILE="${PHASE_DIR}/SUMMARY.md"
if [ ! -f "$SUMMARY_FILE" ]; then
  cat > "$SUMMARY_FILE" << EOF
# Build Summary — Phase ${PHASE_NUMBER}

**Started:** $(date -Iseconds)
**Plan:** ${PLAN_FILE}
**Model:** ${MODEL_EXECUTOR}

EOF
  echo "SUMMARY.md initialized at ${SUMMARY_FILE}"
fi
```

Executors append their task summary sections to this file (per vg-executor-rules.md "Task summary output").
After all waves, step 9 verifies every task has a section.

### 8b: Tag wave start (for rollback) + init progress file

```bash
git tag "vg-build-${PHASE}-wave-${N}-start" HEAD
WAVE_TAG="vg-build-${PHASE}-wave-${N}-start"

# Init compact-safe progress file — survives context compacts + crashes.
# Orchestrator (or user via --status) can read .vg/phases/{phase}/.build-progress.json
# anytime to see "committed [15,19], in-flight [16], failed [18]".

# already exists for the packages this wave touches.
#
# Heuristic: get distinct app names from PLAN file-paths, bootstrap each.
BOOTSTRAP_PKGS=$(grep -hoE '<file-path>apps/[^/]+' "${PHASE_DIR}"/PLAN*.md 2>/dev/null \
  | sed 's|<file-path>apps/||' | sort -u)
for pkg in $BOOTSTRAP_PKGS; do

export VG_BUILD_PHASE_DIR="$PHASE_DIR"
```

### 8c: Spawn executor per task in wave

**PRE-FLIGHT (MANDATORY before ANY executor spawn):**

Before spawning, the orchestrator MUST verify step 4 artifacts exist. If missing, run step 4 NOW:

```
CHECK these files exist (not empty):
  1. ${PHASE_DIR}/.callers.json     (from step 4e — semantic regression)
  2. ${PHASE_DIR}/.wave-context/    (from step 4c — sibling detection)

IF EITHER missing:
  1. Read .claude/vg.config.md — extract graphify.enabled, semantic_regression.enabled
  2. Run step 4c: find-siblings.py for each task (creates .wave-context/siblings-task-{N}.json)
  3. Run step 4e: build-caller-graph.py (creates .callers.json)
  4. Run step 4d: extract task sections from PLAN*.md

This prevents resume from skipping context injection — executor without sibling/caller
context produces code that may break cross-module dependencies.
```

**FILE CONFLICT DETECTION (MANDATORY before parallel spawn):**

Parse `<file-path>` from each task in the current wave. If 2+ tasks edit the SAME file,
those tasks MUST run sequentially (not parallel) to prevent git staging race conditions.

```bash
# Collect file paths per task in wave (grep within each task's extracted section)
WAVE_FILES=()
for task_num in "${WAVE_TASKS[@]}"; do
  TASK_FILE="${PHASE_DIR}/.wave-tasks/task-${task_num}.md"
  if [ -f "$TASK_FILE" ]; then
    FILE_PATH=$(grep -oP '<file-path>\K[^<]+' "$TASK_FILE" | head -1)
  else
    # Fallback: grep task section directly from PLAN*.md
    FILE_PATH=$(awk "/^#{2,3} Task 0?${task_num}[^0-9]/,/^#{2,3} (Task|Wave)/" "${PHASE_DIR}"/PLAN*.md 2>/dev/null \
      | grep -oP '<file-path>\K[^<]+' | head -1)
  fi
  [ -n "$FILE_PATH" ] && WAVE_FILES+=("${task_num}:${FILE_PATH}")
done

# Detect conflicts — same file in 2+ tasks
CONFLICT_GROUPS=""
SEEN_FILES=$(printf '%s\n' "${WAVE_FILES[@]}" | cut -d: -f2 | sort | uniq -d)
if [ -n "$SEEN_FILES" ]; then
  echo "⚠ File conflict in wave ${N}:"
  for file in $SEEN_FILES; do
    TASKS=$(printf '%s\n' "${WAVE_FILES[@]}" | grep ":${file}$" | cut -d: -f1 | tr '\n' ',')
    echo "  ${file} → Tasks ${TASKS}"
    CONFLICT_GROUPS="${CONFLICT_GROUPS} ${TASKS}"
  done
  echo "  → Conflicting tasks will run SEQUENTIALLY within this wave."
fi

```

**Why:** When 2+ parallel agents edit the same file, git staging races cause one agent's
changes to be absorbed into another's commit — the second agent loses its own commit silently.
Detection prevents this class of bugs by forcing conflicting tasks to run sequentially.

**⛔ SPAWN PLAN ENFORCEMENT (orchestrator MUST follow):**

Orchestrator đọc `${PHASE_DIR}/.wave-spawn-plan.json` và spawn theo 2 group:
1. **parallel[]** — spawn Agent cho mỗi task trong 1 message (multiple tool calls). Wait all.
2. **sequential_groups[][]** — mỗi group spawn từng task 1, wait mỗi task trước khi spawn next.

```
Example plan:
{
  "parallel": [1, 2, 5],
  "sequential_groups": [[3, 4], [6, 7, 8]]
}
Spawn order:
  Message 1: Agent(task 1) + Agent(task 2) + Agent(task 5)   # parallel batch
  Message 2: Agent(task 3), wait, Agent(task 4)             # group [3,4] serial
  Message 3: Agent(task 6), wait, Agent(task 7), wait, Agent(task 8)   # group [6,7,8] serial
```

**POST-SPAWN verification** chạy trong step 8d — compare `.build-progress.json` timestamps
vs plan. Nếu sequential_groups overlap (parallel execution) → R5 violation, BLOCK wave.

DO NOT SKIP THIS. If scripts are missing or fail, inject:
  <sibling_context>UNAVAILABLE — scripts not found. Review peer modules manually.</sibling_context>
  <downstream_callers>UNAVAILABLE — caller graph not built. Check imports manually.</downstream_callers>
```

**Record task as in-flight BEFORE Agent() spawn (compact-safe):**
```bash
# Progress file → tasks_in_flight[] so --status reflects reality even
# after a context compact. Agent ID isn't known at spawn; fill "pending".
source "${REPO_ROOT:-.}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/build-progress.sh"
vg_build_progress_start_task "$PHASE_DIR" "$TASK_NUM" "pending-agent"
```

**Fill context variables via pre-executor-check.py (deterministic, not pseudocode):**
```bash
# Run ONCE per task — outputs JSON with all context blocks ready
TASK_CAPSULE_DIR="${PHASE_DIR}/.task-context-capsules"
mkdir -p "$TASK_CAPSULE_DIR" 2>/dev/null

# ─── Phase 16 hot-fix (v2.11.1) — split persist (BLOCKers 2+3) ────────────
# Cross-AI consensus rework: previous code wrapped BOTH the prompt body
# persist AND the meta sidecar persist inside the UI/design conditional.
# Two failure modes:
#   (B2) UI tasks: ${TASK_NUM}.md contained UI-MAP wrapper, NOT task body —
#        verify-task-fidelity.py compared against that wrapper's line count
#        → false BLOCK on every UI task (test fixture bypassed by writing
#        body directly to disk).
#   (B3) Backend tasks (no UI subtree, no design context): step 8c
#        short-circuited entirely → no meta.json → audit silent PASS →
#        orchestrator could paraphrase backend task bodies freely.
#
# Now: 3 file shapes, 2 always-on + 1 conditional:
#   ${TASK_NUM}.body.md  — raw task body (what the executor's <task_context>
#                          should mirror). Always persisted. Read by
#                          verify-task-fidelity.py for hash compare.
#   ${TASK_NUM}.meta.json — D-01 sidecar with source_block_sha256. Always
#                          persisted. Read by verify-task-fidelity.py.
#   ${TASK_NUM}.uimap.md  — D-12a UI-MAP+DESIGN-REF wrapper. Only persisted
#                          for UI tasks. Read by verify-uimap-injection.py.

**Spawn executor agent (one per plan task):**

⛔ **HARD RULE — ZERO EXCEPTIONS:**
- subagent_type **MUST** be `general-purpose`
- **NEVER** spawn `gsd-executor`, `gsd-execute-phase`, or any agent whose
  name starts with `gsd-` (other than `gsd-debugger`, used elsewhere in
  step 12 only).

**Why this rule exists:**

`gsd-executor` IS a real agent registered globally at
`~/.claude/agents/gsd-executor.md` (it ships with the GSD workflow,
which is unrelated to VG). Its description reads "Executes GSD plans
with atomic commits, deviation handling, checkpoint protocols". When
the orchestrator (this skill) dispatches plan tasks, that description
pattern-matches your task — Claude Code's agent picker has historically
preferred `gsd-executor` over `general-purpose` for plan-execution
prompts. **You must override that picker.**

VG's executor rules differ from GSD's:
- VG forbids `--no-verify` (commit-msg hook MUST run); GSD allows it in parallel mode
- VG requires `Per CONTEXT.md D-XX` body citation; GSD does not
- VG L1-L6 design fidelity gates require structured evidence; GSD has none
- VG enforces task context capsule with vision-decomposition; GSD doesn't load it

If you spawn `gsd-executor`, the GSD rule set wins, VG gates silently
skip, and downstream `/vg:review` + `/vg:test` fail with "phantom"
artifacts that look correct but were authored under wrong contract.

**Concrete check before every spawn:**
- Wave status line in your output **must read** `general-purpose(Wave N Task M)`.
- If you see `gsd-executor(...)` or `gsd-execute-phase(...)` — STOP, abort the spawn, re-spawn with `subagent_type="general-purpose"` explicit.
- If your project's CLAUDE.md contains stale prose like "gsd-executor spawned by /vg:build", IGNORE it. Authority is THIS skill body and inline `<vg_executor_rules>` injected per task.

**Programmatic enforcement (v2.27.0+):** A PreToolUse hook
(`scripts/vg-agent-spawn-guard.py`, wired via `vg-hooks-install.py`)
intercepts every Agent tool call during an active VG run and DENIES
spawn with a clear reason if `subagent_type` matches `gsd-*` (except
`gsd-debugger`). The deny reason is delivered to your next turn so
you re-spawn with `general-purpose`. If you see the deny message
referencing `vg-agent-spawn-guard.py`, that's the hook firing
correctly — fix the spawn, not the hook.

- Design context (if present): ~300 lines (includes image tokens)
- Sibling module signatures: ~200 lines
- Wave context: ~300 lines
- Execution context (CLAUDE.md + GSD generic): ~300 lines

Modern Claude 200k context comfortable — 2000 lines ≈ 30k tokens ≈ 15% budget.
Starving context causes drift; expand to eliminate guess.

Verify orchestrator honored `.wave-spawn-plan.json` — sequential_groups must have ran one-at-a-time (no timestamp overlap). If violated → commit race likely → BLOCK before commit count check masks the issue.

fi
```

**Why:** Agents can fail silently — target file doesn't exist, dependency missing, or agent
hits an error but doesn't commit. Without this count check, orchestrator proceeds to next wave
on broken state. Commit count verification catches all silent agent failures deterministically.

**Step 0b — Commit attribution audit (MANDATORY, run after count check):**

Commit count gate passes if N tasks → N commits. But parallel executors can race
on `.git/index`: agent A's `git add fileA.ts` lands before agent B's `git commit`,
so agent B absorbs fileA.ts silently. Count = N, but attribution is corrupted.

Run the attribution verifier to catch this class of race:

```bash
# Source override-debt helper once — every override site below calls log_override_debt
# so the debt register stays in sync with build-state.log (was previously OUT of sync —
# build-state.log had overrides, OVERRIDE-DEBT.md never saw them).
source "${REPO_ROOT:-.}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/override-debt.sh" 2>/dev/null || \
  echo "⚠ override-debt.sh missing — overrides will log to build-state.log only"

ATTR_SCRIPT=".claude/scripts/verify-commit-attribution.py"
if [ -f "$ATTR_SCRIPT" ]; then
  # Default strict mode — flags files not matching any task's <file-path>
  # (orchestration allowlist exempts SUMMARY.md, PIPELINE-STATE.json, step-markers)
  if ! ${PYTHON_BIN:-python} "$ATTR_SCRIPT" \
       --phase-dir "${PHASE_DIR}" \
       --wave-tag "${WAVE_TAG}" \
       --wave-number "${N}" \
       --strict; then
    echo ""
    echo "⛔ Commit attribution violations detected in wave ${N}."
    echo "   Root cause: executor agent(s) bypassed build-commit-queue mutex."
    echo "   See: .claude/commands/vg/_shared/vg-executor-rules.md § Parallel-wave commit safety"
    echo ""
    echo "   Fix paths:"

    echo "     (b) /vg:build ${PHASE_NUMBER} --wave ${N}  # re-run wave (agents will use mutex)"
    echo "     (c) --override-reason=<issue-id>  # accept + log for acceptance review"
    echo ""

    OVERRIDE_REASON=""
    if [[ "${ARGUMENTS:-}" =~ --override-reason=([^[:space:]]+) ]]; then
      OVERRIDE_REASON="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    fi
    if [ -n "$OVERRIDE_REASON" ] && [ ${#OVERRIDE_REASON} -ge 4 ]; then
      echo "⚠ Attribution gate OVERRIDDEN (reason: $OVERRIDE_REASON)"
      echo "attribution-violations: wave-${N} override=${OVERRIDE_REASON} ts=$(date -u +%FT%TZ)" >> "${PHASE_DIR}/build-state.log"
      type -t log_override_debt >/dev/null 2>&1 && log_override_debt \
        "--override-reason" "$PHASE_NUMBER" "build.attribution.wave-${N}" "$OVERRIDE_REASON" "build-attribution-wave-${N}"
    else
      exit 1
    fi
  fi
else
  echo "⚠ verify-commit-attribution.py missing — skipping attribution audit (older install)"
fi
```

The attribution verifier:
1. Parses each wave commit's `type(phase-task):` to infer which task produced it
2. Reads `.wave-tasks/task-{N}.md` for that task's `<file-path>` expectation
3. Classifies each changed file: `own-main`, `own-test`, `own-dir`, `orchestration`, `other-task:M`, or `unrelated`
4. Fails (exit 2) if any file is `other-task:M` (cross-attribution) or `unrelated` in strict mode

This is the safety net. The PRIMARY fix is that executors hold the commit-queue
mutex, preventing the race at the source. See vg-executor-rules.md.

**Step 0c — Wave integrity reconciliation (MANDATORY, survives crashes):**

Runs `verify-wave-integrity.py` against the progress file + git log + filesystem.
Catches crash scenarios where agent work exists on disk but progress file never
recorded it (SIGKILL during work, context compact mid-wave, power failure).

Phase 10 Wave 5 reality check: apps/web tsc OOM killed 3 agents; their ~1500
LOC was still on disk but orphaned. Integrity verifier rescued the work. Without
this running automatically, user had to know to invoke it manually. Now auto.

**Phase 15 D-12a — UI-MAP + design-ref injection audit (NEW, 2026-04-27):**

`## UI-MAP-SUBTREE-FOR-THIS-WAVE` and `## DESIGN-REF` H2 sections were

```

**Phase 16 D-06 — Task fidelity audit (orchestrator paraphrase detection):**

Post-spawn 3-way hash audit. For each (wave × task) pair under
`.build/wave-${N}/executor-prompts/`, compares:
  1. PLAN.md task block re-extracted now (current truth)
  2. .meta.json sidecar (snapshot at spawn time, P16 D-01)
  3. .md prompt body (what executor actually received)

Detects 2 failure modes:
- PLAN drift since spawn (rare; mid-build edit → WARN)
- Body shortfall (orchestrator paraphrase / truncate):
    ≤10% PASS, 10-30% WARN, >30% BLOCK

Closes the PARAPHRASE leg of the "AI lazy-read blueprint" failure mode
(P15 W9 closed SPAWN AUDIT, v2.11.0 closed MISSING + TRUNCATION).

**Step 4 — Record wave result:**
```bash
# Append wave status to blueprint-state or build-state
echo "wave-${N}: ${FAILED_GATE:-passed} (retries: ${RETRY_COUNT})" >> "${PHASE_DIR}/build-state.log"
```

**Step 4b — Post-wave independent verify (v2.5 Phase A, 2026-04-23):**

Spawn fresh subprocess to re-run typecheck/tests/contract scoped to wave's changed files. Compare with executor's claims in commit messages. Divergence → rollback wave via `git reset --soft` + set FAILED_GATE.

Critical: runs AFTER commit mutex released (commit_sha stable) but BEFORE next wave starts mutating index. Outside commit-queue to avoid serializing parallelism.

```bash
# Only run if wave succeeded and bash log integrity passed

**Step 4c — Post-wave graphify refresh (MANDATORY when graphify.enabled=true):**

```bash

# that just landed. Without this, wave N+1 can read stale sibling/caller
# context and copy wrong patterns from pre-build code.

<step name="8_5_bootstrap_reflection_per_wave">
## Step 8.5: End-of-Wave Reflection (v1.15.0 Bootstrap Overlay)

Unlike scope/blueprint/review (reflect once per step), `/vg:build` reflects
**after each wave completes** — build is long-running and multiple learnings
may emerge mid-step (typecheck OOM, test flakiness, commit discipline).

**Skip silently if `.vg/bootstrap/` absent.** Per wave:

```bash
if [ -d ".vg/bootstrap" ]; then
  REFLECT_STEP="wave-${WAVE_NUMBER}"
  REFLECT_TS=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
  REFLECT_OUT="${PHASE_DIR}/reflection-${REFLECT_STEP}-${REFLECT_TS}.yaml"
  echo "📝 End-of-wave ${WAVE_NUMBER} reflection..."

  # Explicit marker for orchestrator (v1.14.4+ — was implicit prose-only)
  echo "▸ REFLECTION_TRIGGER_REQUIRED step=${REFLECT_STEP} out=${REFLECT_OUT}"
  echo "  Orchestrator MUST: read .claude/commands/vg/_shared/reflection-trigger.md → Agent spawn vg-reflector"
  echo "  Skip allowed via: --skip-reflection (logs override-debt)"

  # Telemetry — reflection requested (will pair with reflection_completed in step 9 verify)
  if type -t emit_telemetry_v2 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    emit_telemetry_v2 "reflection_requested" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" "build.8_5" "wave-${WAVE_NUMBER}" "PENDING" \
      "{\"wave\":${WAVE_NUMBER},\"out\":\"${REFLECT_OUT}\"}"
  fi
fi
```

**Rate limit:** max 1 reflection per wave. If 0 candidates → silent.

**Post-wave verify (added in step 9 `9_post_execution`):**
- If `.vg/bootstrap/` present + wave succeeded → `reflection-wave-N-*.yaml` MUST exist
- Missing reflection file = WARN (not block) + log telemetry `reflection_skipped` for `/vg:gate-stats` visibility
- Override: `--skip-reflection` flag bypasses warn, logs override-debt
</step>

<step name="9_post_execution">
Aggregate results:
- Count completed plans, failed plans
- Check all SUMMARY*.md files exist
- Check build-state.log — all waves passed gate? (no wave should have lingering failure)

### 9-pre-uxgates: i18n + a11y lightweight gates (v1.14.4+)

<step name="11_crossai_build_verify_loop">
## Step 11: OHOK-7 MANDATORY CrossAI build verification loop

After wave execution + post-mortem, we MUST verify the build actually
completed against its 4 source-of-truth artifacts (API-CONTRACTS.md,
TEST-GOALS.md, CONTEXT.md decisions, PLAN.md tasks). This is ENFORCED
by `build-crossai-required.py` validator at run-complete — no "promise"
path; events.db evidence required.

**Flow**:

```
for iteration in 1..5:
  Run: python .claude/scripts/vg-build-crossai-loop.py \
          --phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} --iteration ${iter} --max-iterations 5

  Exit code 0 (CLEAN):
    - Both Codex + Gemini report no BLOCK findings
    - Emit build.crossai_loop_complete → BREAK out of loop
    - Build done
  Exit code 1 (BLOCKS_FOUND):
    - Read ${PHASE_DIR}/crossai-build-verify/findings-iter${iter}.json
    - Spawn Sonnet Task subagent:
      * description: "Fix CrossAI BLOCK findings iter ${iter}"
      * prompt: findings JSON + artifact paths + "fix each BLOCK, commit
                with feat(${phase}-${iter}.fixN): subject"
    - After subagent returns, continue to iter+1
  Exit code 2 (CLI_INFRA_FAILURE):
    - Retry once. If still fails, prompt user (CLI down / network / quota)

After loop:
  If cleaned before max: emit build.crossai_loop_complete (already done on
                          clean exit, just a safety)
  If 5 iterations exhausted WITHOUT clean:
    - Emit build.crossai_loop_exhausted
    - Prompt user with 3 options:
      (a) continue — run another 5 iterations
      (b) defer — proceed to /vg:review with remaining findings as known
          issues (emit build.crossai_loop_user_override)
      (c) skip + HARD debt — emit build.crossai_loop_user_override +
          vg-orchestrator override --flag=skip-crossai-build-loop
          --reason='<URL + explanation, ≥50ch>'
```

**Fix subagent model**: Sonnet (`claude-sonnet-4-6`). Sonnet is:
- Fast enough to not bloat loop runtime (~1 min per fix)
- Strong enough for contract-gap level fixes
- Isolated context so main Claude doesn't accumulate fix noise

**Severity threshold for triggering fix**: ANY BLOCK finding from either
CLI. MEDIUM/LOW findings are captured but deferred to /vg:review or
/vg:test phase (not blocking the build loop).

**Prompt template for fix subagent**:

```
You are fixing CrossAI BLOCK findings from build iteration ${N} of phase ${P}.

Read findings: ${PHASE_DIR}/crossai-build-verify/findings-iter${N}.json

For each finding with severity=BLOCK:
  1. Read the file at finding.file
  2. Understand the gap (finding.message) against the artifact ref
     (finding.artifact_ref — D-XX / G-XX / endpoint / task)
  3. Apply the minimal fix per finding.fix_hint
  4. Commit with: feat(${P}-${N}.fix${K}): <finding.artifact_ref>
     body: "Per CrossAI iter ${N} — <finding.message>"

Do NOT refactor, do NOT add features beyond the fix. Stop and return.
```

**IMPORTANT — this step is Claude-orchestrated, not bash-looped.**

Bash auto-loop was wrong: re-running CrossAI on SAME unfixed code just
re-produces the same findings. Main Claude (Opus) MUST orchestrate
iteration-by-iteration with Sonnet Task subagent fixing between iters.

```bash
# Phase 1 — iteration 1: establish baseline
CROSSAI_PHASE="${PHASE_NUMBER:-${PHASE_ARG}}"
CROSSAI_MAX_ITER=5
echo "▸ CrossAI build-verify iteration 1/${CROSSAI_MAX_ITER}..."
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" .claude/scripts/vg-build-crossai-loop.py \
  --phase "${CROSSAI_PHASE}" --iteration 1 --max-iterations ${CROSSAI_MAX_ITER}
CROSSAI_RC=$?
echo "▸ iter 1 exit code: ${CROSSAI_RC} (0=CLEAN, 1=BLOCKS_FOUND, 2=INFRA_FAILURE)"
```

**Now the orchestrator (main Claude Opus) reads CROSSAI_RC and decides**:

- **CROSSAI_RC = 0**: loop script already emitted `build.crossai_loop_complete`.
  Proceed directly to step 12 (run-complete). Build done clean at iter 1.

- **CROSSAI_RC = 1**: BLOCK findings exist at
  `${PHASE_DIR}/crossai-build-verify/findings-iter1.json`.
  **Opus MUST dispatch a Sonnet Task subagent** with the findings JSON +
  fix prompt (see template above). Subagent reads each finding, applies
  minimal fix, commits with `feat(${PHASE}-1.fixN):` subject. After
  subagent returns (all BLOCKS fixed + committed), Opus re-invokes:
  ```bash
  "${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" .claude/scripts/vg-build-crossai-loop.py \
    --phase "${CROSSAI_PHASE}" --iteration 2 --max-iterations ${CROSSAI_MAX_ITER}
  ```
  Repeat: exit 0 → done; exit 1 → fix + iter 3; ... up to iter 5.

- **CROSSAI_RC = 2**: CLI infra failure (Codex/Gemini network/timeout/parse
  fail). Opus investigates (check `${PHASE_DIR}/crossai-build-verify/
  codex-iter*.md` + `gemini-iter*.md` for error detail). Either retry
  the same iteration after fixing infra OR escalate to user for override.

**After iter 5 without clean** — Opus MUST prompt user with 3 options:

```
━━━ ACTION REQUIRED — CrossAI loop exhausted ━━━

5 iterations ran without clean. Remaining BLOCK findings listed in
${PHASE_DIR}/crossai-build-verify/findings-iter5.json.

Pick one:
  (a) continue — spawn another Sonnet fix round + run iterations 6-10
  (b) defer — record exhausted + proceed to /vg:review with remaining
      findings as known issues. Runs:
      python .claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator emit-crossai-terminal exhausted \
        --payload '{"iterations":5,"reason":"user_deferred"}'
  (c) skip + HARD debt — requires override.used with crossai flag:
      python .claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator override \
        --flag=skip-crossai-build-loop --reason='<ticket URL or SHA ≥50ch>'
      python .claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator emit-crossai-terminal user_override
```

Opus presents options, user picks, Opus invokes the chosen command. Run-
complete (step 12) BLOCKs until ONE of the three terminal events lands.

**Why no bash while-loop**: the fix between iterations needs a Task subagent
(Sonnet with isolated context reading findings-iterN.json), which a bash
block can't spawn. Each iteration is a discrete Claude-orchestrated step.

**If Opus bypasses this step** entirely: step 12 fires
`build-crossai-required` validator which sees 0 iteration events → BLOCK.
No way to skip via "promise" — events.db evidence required (OHOK-7/8).

Re-run `/vg:build {phase}` to resume — discovers plans, skips completed SUMMARYs.
