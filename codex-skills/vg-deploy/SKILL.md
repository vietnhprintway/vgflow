## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Native Codex tasklist/plan projection + orchestrator step markers | Use `tasklist-contract.json` as source of truth. After projecting, emit `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter codex`; if no native task UI is exposed, use `--adapter fallback` and `run-status --pretty`. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code and Codex now both have project-local hook substrates. VGFlow
`sync.sh`/`install.sh` installs `.codex/hooks.json` plus
`.codex/config.toml` with `[features].codex_hooks = true`. Codex hooks
wrap the same orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`, while command-body
guards remain mandatory because Codex hook coverage is still tool-path scoped:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Codex wrapper accepts both `/vg:cmd` and `$vg-cmd`; command-body `vg-orchestrator run-start` is still mandatory and must BLOCK if missing/failing |
| `PreToolUse` Bash -> `hooks/vg-pre-tool-use-bash.sh` | Blocks `vg-orchestrator step-active` until tasklist projection evidence is signed | Codex wrapper sets `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`/`CLAUDE_HOOK_SESSION_ID` from Codex `session_id` and forwards to the same gate |
| `PreToolUse` Write/Edit -> `hooks/vg-pre-tool-use-write.sh` | Blocks direct writes to protected evidence, marker, and event paths | Codex `apply_patch` wrapper at `codex-hooks/vg-pre-tool-use-apply-patch.py` blocks the same protected paths before patch application |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Codex wrapper forwards Bash results to the same tracker; explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines remain required |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Codex wrapper runs the same verifier; command-body terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` is still required before claiming completion |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Codex hook processes cannot mutate the environment of later shell tool calls.
If a command-body shell lacks `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, `vg-orchestrator` recovers
the session from `.vg/.session-context.json` and the matching
`.vg/active-runs/<session>.json`. Do not create a fresh run when the
UserPromptSubmit hook already registered the same command/phase.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

Run fenced command-body shell snippets with Bash explicitly, for example
`/bin/bash -lc '<snippet>'`, instead of the user's login shell. VGFlow source
commands use Bash semantics such as `[[ ... ]]`, arrays, `BASH_SOURCE`, and
`set -u`; zsh can misinterpret those snippets and create false failures.

Do not manually retype long command-body heredocs into nested shell strings.
Prefer deterministic Codex helpers shipped in `.claude/scripts/`. For
`/vg:blueprint` STEP 3.1, run `codex-vg-env.py` and
`codex-blueprint-plan-prep.py` exactly as documented in
`_shared/blueprint/plan-overview.md`; then spawn the planner from the prepared
prompt. This avoids zsh glob/quote expansion corrupting Python heredocs before
Bash executes them.

Before running any command-body snippet that calls validators, orchestrator
helpers, or `${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}`, execute the Python detection block from
`.claude/commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md` in that same Bash shell and
export the selected `PYTHON_BIN`. Do not reset `PYTHON_BIN=python3` after
detection: on macOS, bare `python3` is often an older interpreter without
PyYAML, which makes VG validators fail even though a valid Homebrew/Python.org
interpreter is installed.

Each Codex shell tool call starts with a fresh environment. If a later command
invokes `.claude/scripts/*`, validators, or `vg-orchestrator`, redetect
`PYTHON_BIN` or carry the previously detected absolute interpreter into that
same command. Do not run `python3 .claude/scripts/...` directly for VG
validators/orchestrator calls.

`vg-orchestrator` command shapes are positional. Use
`vg-orchestrator step-active <step_name>`,
`vg-orchestrator mark-step <namespace> <step_name>`, and
`vg-orchestrator emit-event <event_type> --payload '{...}'`. Do not use
`step-active <namespace> <step>`, `event --type`, or grouped helper calls
that mix tasklist projection with the first step marker.

For tasklist projection, Codex must write evidence as soon as
`tasklist-contract.json` exists: after `emit-tasklist.py`, run
`vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter codex` as its own tool call.
Do not group `tasklist-projected` and `step-active` in one shell command;
PreToolUse evaluates the entire command before the evidence file exists and
will block the grouped command. Some command preflights have bootstrap steps
before `emit-tasklist.py`; only those declared bootstrap steps may run before
the tasklist contract exists.

For top-level VG commands that include a mandatory `git commit` step, ensure
the parent Codex session can write Git metadata. Some Codex
`workspace-write` sandboxes deny `.git/index.lock`; when that happens,
BLOCK and ask the operator to rerun with a sandbox/profile that permits Git
metadata writes instead of skipping or forging the commit marker.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --spawn-role "<vg-subagent-role>" \
  --spawn-id "<stable-spawn-id>" \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.
When `--spawn-role` is set, it also writes Codex spawn evidence to
`.vg/runs/<run_id>/codex-spawns/` and appends
`.vg/runs/<run_id>/.codex-spawn-manifest.jsonl`. Codex Bash hooks block
heavy-step markers and `wave-complete` when required spawn evidence or
build wave `.spawn-count.json` is missing.

When creating prompt files for `codex-spawn.sh`, use a single-quoted heredoc
delimiter such as `cat > "$PROMPT_FILE" <<'EOF'` or write from an existing
template. Do not use unquoted `<<EOF` for prompts that contain backticks,
`$...`, command substitutions, or markdown code fences: the shell will
expand them before Codex sees the prompt and can corrupt the child contract.
If runtime variables must be injected, prefer a small controlled render step
that substitutes placeholders after the quoted template is written.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

<HARD-GATE>
You MUST follow STEP 0 through `complete` in exact order. Each step is gated
by hooks. Skipping ANY step will be blocked by PreToolUse + Stop hooks.

You MUST call TodoWrite IMMEDIATELY after STEP 0 (`0_parse_and_validate`)
runs `emit-tasklist.py` — DO NOT continue without it. The PreToolUse Bash
hook will block all subsequent step-active calls until signed evidence
exists at `.vg/runs/<run_id>/.tasklist-projected.evidence.json`. The
PostToolUse TodoWrite hook auto-writes that signed evidence.

TodoWrite MUST include sub-items (`↳` prefix) for each group header;
flat projection (group-headers only) is rejected by the PostToolUse
depth check (Task 44b Rule V2 — `depth_valid=false` evidence triggers
the PreToolUse depth gate).
</HARD-GATE>

<rules>
1. **Build must be complete** — PIPELINE-STATE.steps.build.status ∈ {accepted, tested, reviewed, built-with-debt, built-complete}. Otherwise BLOCK (override: `--allow-build-incomplete` logs override-debt).
2. **Multi-env supported, sequential execution** — each env runs after the previous completes. Parallel would risk infrastructure contention (shared SSH connection, same DB seed, etc).
3. **Prod requires explicit confirmation** — separate AskUserQuestion 3-option danger gate (PROCEED / NON-PROD-ONLY / ABORT). For non-interactive runs, `--prod-confirm-token=DEPLOY-PROD-{phase}` must match exactly.
4. **Per-env failure handling** — DOES NOT auto-abort remaining envs. Ask user continue/skip-failed/abort-all. Failed env writes `health: "failed"` + error log.
5. **DEPLOY-STATE.json merges** — preserves `preferred_env_for` (set by /vg:scope step 1b), `preferred_env_for_skipped` flag, and any unrelated future keys. Only `deployed.{env}` block is rewritten per run.
6. **Rollback hint** — capture `previous_sha` from existing `deployed.{env}.sha` BEFORE overwriting. Future `/vg:rollback` consumer reads this.
7. **--dry-run** prints commands but doesn't execute. Useful for verifying config + flags before real deploy.
</rules>

<objective>
Standalone optional skill bridging /vg:build → /vg:review/test/roam. User
runs `/vg:deploy <phase>` after build, picks one or more envs, this skill
runs the canonical deploy sequence per env (build → restart → health) on
that target, captures SHA + timestamp + health into
`${PHASE_DIR}/DEPLOY-STATE.json` `deployed.{env}` block.

Downstream env gates (review/test/roam step 0a) read this state via
`enrich-env-question.py` (B1) and surface "deployed Nmin ago, sha XXXX"
evidence in the AskUserQuestion options. The pipeline becomes:

```
specs → scope → blueprint → build → [DEPLOY] → review → test → [roam] → accept
                                       ↑                  ↑      ↑       ↑
                                   writes              all read DEPLOY-STATE
                                   DEPLOY-STATE        for env recommendation
```

This skill never auto-picks env at runtime gates — those still fire
AskUserQuestion. /vg:deploy just feeds the suggestion data layer.

## Step 0a — Select envs (multi-select) + prod danger gate

**MANDATORY FIRST ACTION** (before any deploy work) — invoke

- `${ARGUMENTS}` contains `--envs=<csv>` (parse + validate)
- `${ARGUMENTS}` contains `--all-envs` (deploy to ALL configured envs except local)
- `${ARGUMENTS}` contains `--non-interactive` (require `--envs=` to be set)

### Resolve selection from CLI flags first

```bash

Refs: `_shared/deploy/per-env-executor-contract.md` (spawn schema + post-spawn
validation), `_shared/deploy/overview.md` (flow). Initialize accumulator
(Step 2 reads this exact path):

```bash
DRY_RUN="false"
[[ "$ARGUMENTS" =~ --dry-run ]] && DRY_RUN="true"

LOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
DEPLOY_RESULTS_JSON="${PHASE_DIR}/.tmp/deploy-results.json"
mkdir -p "${PHASE_DIR}/.tmp"
echo '{"results":[]}' > "$DEPLOY_RESULTS_JSON"
```

For each env in `$SELECTED_ENVS`:

```bash
for env in $(echo "$SELECTED_ENVS" | tr ',' ' '); do
  echo ""
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
  echo "  Deploying to: ${env}"

## Step 2 — Merge results into DEPLOY-STATE.json + summary

Merge per-env results into `${PHASE_DIR}/DEPLOY-STATE.json` `deployed.{env}`
block. Preserves `preferred_env_for` / `preferred_env_for_skipped` and any
unrelated future keys. Print summary table + emit telemetry. Merge logic

<success_criteria>
- Build complete prereq satisfied (or override-debt logged for `--allow-build-incomplete`)
- Selected envs all exist in vg.config.md `environments.{env}` section
- Prod env requires explicit confirmation (interactive AskUserQuestion OR `--prod-confirm-token` match)
- Each env's deploy.{pre,build,restart,health,seed_command} commands run sequentially
- Health check retries up to 30s (6× 5s) before marking failed
- Failed env doesn't auto-abort siblings (interactive: ask user; non-interactive: continue)
- DEPLOY-STATE.json `deployed.{env}` block populated per env, MERGES with existing keys (preserves preferred_env_for)
- previous_sha captured for rollback hint
- phase.deploy_completed telemetry emitted regardless of outcome (with payload listing ok/failed envs)
- Per-env log file `${PHASE_DIR}/.deploy-log.{env}.txt` exists (truncated then appended per run)
