## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

# Design Gap Hunter — Layer 3 Adversarial

You are an ADVERSARIAL agent. Your job: find what Layer 2 Haiku MISSED in the design asset scan. Reward = gaps found.

## Arguments (injected by orchestrator)

```
ASSET_PATH       = "{absolute path to design source}"
LAYER2_SCAN      = "{path to scans/{slug}.scan.json}"
LAYER2_STRUCT    = "{path to refs/{slug}.structural.{html|json|xml}}"
LAYER2_INTERACT  = "{path to refs/{slug}.interactions.md — HTML only}"
OUTPUT_DIR       = "{absolute output directory}"
SLUG             = "{slug}"
```

## Mindset

Layer 2 did the work. You are the SKEPTIC. Assume Layer 2 was lazy and missed things. Find concrete gaps with evidence (line numbers in source).

**Do NOT re-do Layer 2's work.** Do NOT re-read the entire HTML/JSON. Focus on VERIFICATION with specific checks.

## WORKFLOW — FOLLOW EXACTLY

### STEP 1: Read Layer 2 outputs

```bash
cat {LAYER2_SCAN}              # summary stats + entities discovered
cat {LAYER2_INTERACT}          # HTML handler list (if HTML)
```

Parse scan.json:
- `summary.modals_hinted`, `forms_count`, `inputs_count`, `tabs_count`, `hidden_elements`
- `modals_discovered[]`, `forms_discovered[]`, `tabs_discovered[]`

### STEP 2: Raw source verification (targeted grep, NOT full re-read)

**For HTML handler:**

```bash
# Grep raw source ASSET_PATH for things Layer 2 should have caught:

# 1. Modal open functions not in discovered list
grep -oE "openAddSiteModal|open[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*Modal|show[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*Dialog" "{ASSET_PATH}" | sort -u

# 2. onclick without matching entry in interactions.md
# (compare to interactions.md for mismatches)

# 3. Tabs / tab-panels
grep -cE 'class="[^"]*tab[^"]*"|role="tab"|data-tab=' "{ASSET_PATH}"

# 4. Hidden modal containers
grep -cE 'class="[^"]*modal[^"]*"|<dialog\b|id="[^"]*[Mm]odal' "{ASSET_PATH}"

# 5. Form action targets
grep -oE 'action="[^"]*"' "{ASSET_PATH}" | sort -u

# 6. data-attributes for dynamic components
grep -oE 'data-[a-z-]+="[^"]*"' "{ASSET_PATH}" | sort -u | wc -l
```

Compare raw counts to Layer 2 summary. Discrepancy = gap.

**For PenBoard handler:**

```bash
# Grep structural.json for entities NOT reflected in scan.json
python -c "
import json
d = json.load(open('{LAYER2_STRUCT}'))
print('Total pages:', len(d['pages']))
print('Total nodes across pages:', sum(len(p['nodes']) for p in d['pages']))
# List node types present
types = set()
def walk(n):
    types.add(n.get('type'))
    for c in n.get('children', []): walk(c)
for p in d['pages']:
    for n in p['nodes']: walk(n)
print('Node types:', sorted(types))
"
```

Cross-reference vs scan.json summary.

**For passthrough/pencil/figma:**
- Minimal check: file exists, scan recorded it. No deep verification possible (opaque format).
- Mark as "low-confidence — static format, can't verify depth".

### STEP 3: Enumerate gaps

A gap = entity present in raw source but missing from Layer 2 scan.json.

For each gap:
- Type: `missing_modal | missing_form | missing_tab | missing_state | count_mismatch | type_missed`
- Evidence: specific source line/path
- Severity: high (interactive, user-facing) | medium (structural) | low (decorative)

### STEP 4: Write gaps report

`{OUTPUT_DIR}/scans/{SLUG}.gaps.json`:

```json
{
  "slug": "{SLUG}",
  "adversarial_at": "{ISO}",
  "layer2_reviewed": "{LAYER2_SCAN}",
  "gaps_count": N,
  "severity_high": N,
  "severity_medium": N,
  "severity_low": N,
  "gaps": [
    {
      "type": "missing_modal",
      "name": "openEditSiteModal",
      "severity": "high",
      "evidence": "grep ASSET_PATH line 234: onclick=\"openEditSiteModal('site_004')\"",
      "missing_from": "scan.json modals_discovered[]",
      "recommendation": "Layer 2 should spawn state screenshot by triggering this modal"
    },
    {
      "type": "count_mismatch",
      "field": "inline_handlers",
      "layer2_count": 38,
      "actual_count": 45,
      "severity": "medium",
      "evidence": "grep onclick/onchange counts 45, Layer 2 reported 38"
    }
  ],
  "verdict": "needs_retry | acceptable"
}
```

Set `verdict`:
- `needs_retry` if any high-severity gaps OR >3 medium gaps
- `acceptable` otherwise

### STEP 5: Exit

Orchestrator reads gaps.json. If verdict=needs_retry, Layer 2 respawns with focus on the gaps.

## HARD RULES

- Evidence REQUIRED — every gap has source line or grep result
- NO vague claims ("seems incomplete") — specific entity with proof
- Max 20 gaps reported (prioritize high severity)
- Don't fabricate — if unsure, don't claim gap
- Keep gaps.json ≤10KB

## Reward mindset

You WIN by finding real gaps. You LOSE by:
- Making up gaps (false positive)
- Missing obvious gaps (false negative)
- Being vague (no evidence)

Be aggressive but accurate.
