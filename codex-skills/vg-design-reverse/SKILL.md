## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-design-reverse`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.
</codex_skill_adapter>



<rules>
1. **Reverse direction** — opposite of `/vg:design-scaffold`. Scaffold creates mockups for greenfield; reverse captures existing live UI as mockups.
2. **Migration use case** — project already deployed at a URL, has working UI, but lacks Pencil/Figma/HTML source files. Reverse captures current state → enables Phase 19 L1-L6 gates retroactively.
3. **Playwright required** — uses headless Chromium; auto-fail if `node` or `playwright` missing.
4. **Authentication via cookies** — for protected apps, user provides cookies.json (Playwright format). VG cannot login programmatically.
5. **Output convention** — drops PNGs at `${design_assets.paths[0]}/{slug}.png` so `/vg:design-extract` consumes via `passthrough` handler.
6. **NOT a replacement for design files** — captured PNGs are snapshots of CURRENT UI, which may itself be drifted. Use as baseline, not gospel.
</rules>

<objective>
Capture mockup PNGs from a live URL crawl. Output:
  ${design_assets.paths[0]}/{slug}.png            ← per route
  ${design_assets.paths[0]}/.reverse-evidence/{slug}.json  ← capture metadata
</objective>

<process>

<step name="0_validate_prereqs">
## Step 0: Validate prerequisites

```bash
if ! command -v node >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "⛔ node not on PATH. Install: https://nodejs.org/"
  exit 1
fi
if ! npx playwright --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "⚠ Playwright npm package missing. Run: npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium"
  AskUserQuestion: "Install now? [y/N]"
fi
```
</step>

<step name="1_parse_args">
## Step 1: Parse args

```
/vg:design-reverse --base-url https://app.example.com --routes /,/sites,/users
/vg:design-reverse --base-url https://app.example.com --routes /admin --cookies session.json
/vg:design-reverse --base-url https://app.example.com --routes / --full-page --viewport 1920x1080
```

Required:
- `--base-url <URL>` — origin without trailing slash
- `--routes <comma-sep>` — paths to crawl

Optional:
- `--cookies <file>` — Playwright cookies JSON for authenticated routes
- `--viewport WxH` (default 1440x900)
- `--full-page` — capture full scrollable page (default: viewport only)
- `--output-dir` — override `design_assets.paths[0]`
</step>

<step name="2_resolve_output_dir">
```bash
DESIGN_ASSETS_DIR=$(vg_config_get design_assets.paths "" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
DESIGN_ASSETS_DIR="${DESIGN_ASSETS_DIR:-designs}"
mkdir -p "$DESIGN_ASSETS_DIR/.reverse-evidence"
```
</step>

<step name="3_capture">
## Step 3: Run Playwright capture

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN:-python3} .claude/scripts/design-reverse.py \
  --base-url "$BASE_URL" \
  --routes "$ROUTES" \
  --output-dir "$DESIGN_ASSETS_DIR" \
  ${COOKIES:+--cookies "$COOKIES"} \
  --viewport "$VIEWPORT" \
  ${FULL_PAGE:+--full-page} \
  --report "${PHASE_DIR:-.}/.tmp/reverse-report.json"
```

PARTIAL verdict (some routes failed) → continue with WARN, list failures.
PASS → all routes captured.
BLOCK → node/Playwright missing or invalid args.
</step>

<step name="4_auto_extract">
## Step 4: Auto-fire /vg:design-extract

```
SlashCommand: /vg:design-extract --auto
```

Verify `manifest.json` updated with all captured slugs.
</step>

<step name="5_resume">
```
Reverse capture complete.
  Base URL:         $BASE_URL
  Routes captured:  <N>/<TOTAL>
  Output dir:       $DESIGN_ASSETS_DIR
  Evidence:         $DESIGN_ASSETS_DIR/.reverse-evidence/

Next: /vg:design-extract đã chạy. Pages giờ có Form A <design-ref> slug.
      Phase 19 L1-L6 gates engage on next /vg:build.
```
</step>

</process>

<example_use_cases>
1. **Migration project**: RTB has live admin SPA at https://rtb.app/ with no Figma. Run reverse on /admin, /sites, /campaigns → 3 baseline PNGs → enable Phase 19 gates.
2. **Doc-as-design**: capture a competitor's site as reference for design discussion (NOT for L1-L6 ground truth — copyright concerns).
3. **Snapshot before refactor**: capture pre-refactor state → run scaffold for new design → diff side-by-side via `/vg:accept` Section D.
