## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

<rules>
1. **Greenfield on-ramp** — closes the upstream gap exposed by Phase 19. Without scaffold, projects with zero mockups bypass every L1-L6 gate via Form B.
2. **Tool selector** — user-driven via AskUserQuestion or `--tool=<name>` flag. Default recommendation: `pencil-mcp` (free + automated + binary output ideal for downstream gates).
3. **Files converge** — every tool produces files at `$(vg_resolve_design_dir "$PHASE_DIR" phase)/<slug>.{ext}` so `/vg:design-extract` and `/vg:build` resolve the same phase-local assets.
4. **Bulk by default** — multi-page generation in one call; `--interactive` flag opts into per-page review pause.
5. **Auto-regen on DESIGN.md change** — scaffold caches by DESIGN.md SHA256; mockups regenerated when tokens drift.
6. **Idempotent** — re-running with same args + same DESIGN.md = no-op. `--refresh` forces re-scaffold.
7. **No replacement of /vg:design-system** — orthogonal: design-system manages tokens (DESIGN.md), scaffold consumes them.
</rules>

<objective>
Generate UI mockup files for every page in ROADMAP.md so `/vg:design-extract` has assets to normalize. Output:
  ${PHASE_DIR}/design/<slug>.{pen|html|png|fig}           ← per tool
  ${PHASE_DIR}/.scaffold-evidence/{slug}.json            ← per-page provenance (tool, hash, generated_at)

<step name="1_extract_page_list">
## Step 1: Extract page list

Build the list of pages to scaffold:

1. **Priority order:**
   - `--pages=slug1,slug2,...` flag → use as-is
   - PHASE_DIR PLAN tasks with `<design-ref>SLUG</design-ref>` (Form A only)
   - ROADMAP.md `<page>` declarations
   - Fallback: prompt user to type page list

2. **For each page**, derive metadata from PLAN/ROADMAP:
   - `slug` (kebab-case)
   - `description` (1-line, from task body or page section)
   - `type` (list / form / dashboard / wizard / detail / landing — auto-classify by description regex; user override via interactive prompt)

Write to `${PHASE_DIR}/.tmp/scaffold-pages.json`:

```json
{"pages": [{"slug": "home-dashboard", "description": "...", "type": "dashboard"}, ...]}
```

<step name="2_check_existing_assets">
## Step 2: Check existing assets

```bash
EXISTING=$(find "$DESIGN_ASSETS_DIR" -maxdepth 2 -type f \
  \( -name "*.pen" -o -name "*.html" -o -name "*.png" -o -name "*.fig" -o -name "*.penboard" \) 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
```

If $EXISTING > 0:
- Match each existing file basename against page list slugs.
- Pages with matching file → SKIP (already have mockup).
- Pages without → continue to scaffold.
- If `--refresh` flag → ignore existing, scaffold all.

**Auto-regen check (Q3 = A):** for each existing mockup file, compare its scaffold-evidence entry's `design_md_sha256` field against current DESIGN.md SHA256.
- Mismatch → mark page as "stale", scaffold again.
- Match → skip.
- No evidence file (manually-added mockup) → leave alone (not scaffold-managed).

```
Pages to scaffold: <N>

<step name="3_tool_selector">
## Step 3: Tool selector

If `--tool=<name>` flag → validate name in {pencil-mcp, penboard-mcp, ai-html, claude-design, stitch, v0, figma, manual-html, sketch} and skip prompt.

Else AskUserQuestion with decision matrix:

```
Pages to scaffold: <N>. DESIGN.md: <yes|no>. Recommended: pencil-mcp (auto, free).

Pick a tool:
  [a] pencil-mcp     — Pencil MCP automated (DEFAULT). Output .pen via mcp__pencil__batch_design.
  [b] penboard-mcp   — PenBoard MCP automated (Wave B). Multi-page workspace.
  [c] ai-html        — Claude writes HTML+Tailwind from DESIGN.md tokens. Cheap, inspectable.
  [d] claude-design  — gstack:design-shotgun variants → comparison board → user picks (Wave B).
  [e] stitch         — Google Stitch (manual export). Best aesthetic, no API.
  [f] v0             — Vercel v0 (manual export, paid). React-first.
  [g] figma          — Figma (manual export). Industry standard for designer teams.
  [h] manual-html    — You write HTML mockups by hand. Trivial integration.
  [i] sketch         — Sketch.app (macOS only). Mobile-friendly artboard presets (Wave C D-13).
  [help]             — print full decision matrix + trade-offs.
```

Save choice as `$TOOL` env var.

`--interactive` flag (Q2 = C) is forwarded to tool sub-flow as `INTERACTIVE_MODE=1` env var.
