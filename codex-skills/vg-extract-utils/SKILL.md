## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

<rules>
1. **VG-native** — no GSD delegation. Self-contained.
2. **Config-driven** — reads canonical package name from `PROJECT.md` → `## Shared Utility Contract` table (first column = name, second column = `module.ts`).
3. **Atomic per helper** — each helper extraction is ONE commit. Failure reverts that helper only.
4. **Read-only in `--scan` mode** — default shows candidates, doesn't modify code.
5. **Typecheck gate** — after each extraction, `pnpm turbo typecheck --filter <affected>` must pass. Fail → revert commit.
6. **Layer 1 companion** — complements Layer 2+3 (scope gate + blueprint gate + build gate) that PREVENT new duplicates. This is the one-shot RECOVERY for existing duplicates.
</rules>

<objective>
Migrate duplicate helper declarations from scattered files into the canonical `packages/utils/src/` package, rewriting all imports. Root cause of tsc OOM + graphify god-node noise.

Modes:
- `--scan` (default) — just show ranked candidates, no writes
- `--extract <name>` — extract one helper (e.g. `formatCurrency`)
- `--interactive` — scan + user picks which to extract
- `--threshold N` — only propose helpers with ≥N copies (default 3)
- `--all` — extract every helper above threshold

Pipeline position: anytime after `/vg:project` establishes contract. Run once, then Layer 2+3 prevents regression.

</step>

<step name="4_extract_each">
For each selected helper, spawn a dedicated extraction agent.

**Per-helper agent prompt template** (orchestrator spawns one Agent per name):

```
You are extracting ONE duplicate helper function into the canonical @vollxssp/utils
package. Atomic operation: success → commit. Failure → revert.

Helper name: {NAME}
Canonical package: {CANONICAL_PKG} (path: {CANONICAL_DIR}/src/)
Contract module (from PROJECT.md table, or pick sensible one): {MODULE_TS}

## Your steps

1. **Find all declarations** of `{NAME}` in the repo:
   git grep -n -E "^\s*(export\s+)?(function\s+{NAME}|const\s+{NAME}\s*[:=])" -- '*.ts' '*.tsx' '*.js' '*.jsx'

2. **Read each file's implementation** (use Read tool with line offsets).
   Compare implementations — are they identical? Near-identical? Divergent?

3. **Pick canonical signature + body:**
   - If all implementations are ≈ the same → use any (prefer TypeScript-typed over plain JS)
   - If signatures differ → write the MOST PERMISSIVE (union of params, default values preserve old callers' behavior)
   - If bodies diverge meaningfully → ASK (but before asking, consider: are the divergent variants actually the same intent? Many `formatCurrency` variants differ only in hardcoded "USD" vs configurable — consolidate with `currency='USD'` default)

4. **Write canonical to packages/utils/src/{module}.ts:**
   - If module file exists → ADD the export; preserve existing content
   - If module file is new → CREATE with header comment + export
   - Add TypeScript types (not `any`)
   - Add a unit test at packages/utils/src/__tests__/{module}.test.ts (or extend existing)

5. **Update packages/utils/src/index.ts:**
   - Add `export { {NAME} } from './{module}.js';` (respect existing file style — ESM .js extension if other exports use it)

6. **Rewrite each caller file** that had local declaration:
   - DELETE the local `const {NAME} = ...` / `function {NAME} ...` block
   - ADD `import { {NAME} } from '@vollxssp/utils';` at top (merge with existing `@vollxssp/utils` import if present — don't duplicate)
   - If caller passed extra args (e.g., hardcoded locale) → preserve via call-site args, not inline

7. **Typecheck AFFECTED packages only** (skip apps/web if the extraction doesn't touch it, to avoid OOM):
   - Determine affected packages via caller file paths
   - Run `pnpm --filter <each-affected-package> typecheck` (NOT apps/web unless necessary)
   - If apps/web MUST typecheck: first `vg_typecheck_should_bootstrap web && vg_typecheck_bootstrap web` to seed cache

8. **Commit atomically:**
   - Message: `refactor(utils): extract {NAME} ({N} callers → 1 canonical)`
   - Body citation: `Per PROJECT.md Shared Utility Contract. Removes {N} duplicate declarations.`
   - Covers goal: `utility-contract-migration`

## Rules
- NO mutex needed (extractions run sequentially by orchestrator, not parallel)
- NO `--no-verify` on commit — pre-commit hook MUST pass
- Do NOT edit files in `packages/utils/` other than the module + index + test
- Do NOT change call semantics — behavior must be IDENTICAL before/after for all callers
- If typecheck fails, revert your commit via `git reset --hard HEAD~1` and report failure; DO NOT attempt another commit

## Return
Short report (under 150 words):
- canonical signature chosen + why
- N callers rewritten (list paths)
- typecheck result
- commit SHA
- any divergences that needed judgment calls
```

**Orchestrator flow:**

For each name in SELECTED:
1. NARRATE: `## Extracting {name} ({copy_count} callers)...`
2. **Bootstrap rule injection** — render + emit before spawn:
   ```bash
   source "${REPO_ROOT:-.}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/bootstrap-inject.sh"
   BOOTSTRAP_RULES_BLOCK=$(vg_bootstrap_render_block "${BOOTSTRAP_PAYLOAD_FILE:-}" "build")
   vg_bootstrap_emit_fired "${BOOTSTRAP_PAYLOAD_FILE:-}" "build" "${PHASE_NUMBER:-extract-utils}"
   ```
   Include `<bootstrap_rules>${BOOTSTRAP_RULES_BLOCK}</bootstrap_rules>` block in the spawned Agent's prompt alongside extraction instructions.
3. Spawn Agent (subagent_type=general-purpose, model=${MODEL_EXECUTOR or sonnet})
4. Wait for completion (foreground — sequential, not parallel)
5. Parse report; collect commit SHA
6. If failure → log + skip (don't block other extractions)

Sequential (not parallel) because:
- Parallel extractions can conflict on `index.ts` (both add export → git merge conflict)
- apps/web tsc is heavy — parallel bootstraps blow memory
- Each extraction is fast (~2-5 min) so sequential is acceptable

```bash
EXTRACTED_COUNT=0
FAILED_COUNT=0

Emit extraction summary.

```bash

echo "Attempted:  $((EXTRACTED_COUNT + FAILED_COUNT))"
echo "Succeeded:  $EXTRACTED_COUNT"
echo "Failed:     $FAILED_COUNT"

echo "Next:"
echo "  - Review diff: git log --stat -${EXTRACTED_COUNT}"

<success_criteria>
- `--scan` mode: prints ranked duplicate candidates, writes nothing
- `--extract <name>`: one helper migrated, 1 commit, typecheck green
- `--all`: every above-threshold helper extracted sequentially, each atomic commit
- Canonical exports appear in `packages/utils/src/index.ts`
- Caller files have `import { X } from '@vollxssp/utils'` replacing local declarations
- Final monorepo typecheck passes
- No behavioral change — existing tests still pass
- Re-run `--scan` after extraction shows reduced duplicate count
