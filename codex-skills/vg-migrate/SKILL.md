## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-migrate`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.
</codex_skill_adapter>



<rules>
1. **Non-destructive** — never delete GSD originals. Move to `.gsd-backup/` within phase dir.
2. **MERGE, DO NOT OVERWRITE (tightened 2026-04-17)** — any existing artifact with user-authored content must be merged, not replaced. Agent writes to `{file}.staged` (not target). Before promoting staging → target, run preservation gates:
   - **ID preservation**: every `D-XX` (decisions) / `G-XX` (goals) / `Task N` / endpoint path in original MUST exist in staging. Missing = agent dropped content → ABORT, original untouched.
   - **Body preservation**: each element's body text must be ≥ 80% similar to original (`difflib.SequenceMatcher`). Lower ratio = agent rewrote prose → ABORT.
   - **On fail**: staging kept at `{file}.staged` for user inspection; backup at `.gsd-backup/{file}.{original-ext}`.
   Applies to: CONTEXT.md (step 4), API-CONTRACTS.md (step 5), TEST-GOALS.md (step 6), PLAN.md (step 7).
3. **Idempotent** — running migrate twice on same phase produces same result. Skip already-converted artifacts.
4. **Config-driven** — all format decisions from vg.config.md (contract_format, scan_patterns, etc.)
5. **No hardcoded project values** — endpoint paths, file locations, domain names all from config or code scan.
6. **Profile enforcement** — `(type -t mark_step >/dev/null 2>&1 && mark_step "${PHASE_NUMBER:-unknown}" "migrate" "${PHASE_DIR}") || touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/migrate.done"` at end.
</rules>

<objective>
Convert a phase that was planned/built using GSD workflows into VG-native format.
Ensures all VG pipeline steps (review, test, accept) can run on the migrated phase.

When to use:
- Project previously used GSD, now switching to VG
- Phase has CONTEXT.md (GSD format) but no API-CONTRACTS.md or TEST-GOALS.md
- Phase has old-style PLAN.md without VG task attributes
- `/vg:next` shows phase as `legacy_gsd` type
</objective>

<process>

**Config:** Read .claude/commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md first.

<step name="1_parse_args">
Parse `$ARGUMENTS`: phase number (required, OR `--self-test`), optional flags:
- `--dry-run` — show what would be converted, don't write files
- `--force` — re-convert even if VG artifacts already exist (backup existing first)
- `--skip-contracts` — skip API-CONTRACTS.md generation (manual later)
- `--skip-goals` — skip TEST-GOALS.md generation (manual later)
- `--allow-semantic-gaps` — bypass step 9 VG semantic gates. Logs override-debt. NOT recommended.
- `--allow-hallucinated-eps` — bypass step 4 hallucination check. Logs override-debt.
- `--self-test` — run gate logic on shipped fixture `<vgflow>/fixtures/migrate/legacy-sample/expected/`, diff vs golden report. Deterministic, no AI spawn. Use to verify gate logic correctness after editing migrate.md.

**VG enriched format** (decisions + structured sub-sections):

**UI Components:** none
**Test Scenarios:**
- Database connection established on startup

    1. Keep ALL existing decision text EXACTLY as-is (do not rewrite prose)
    2. ADD 3 sub-sections after each decision: Endpoints, UI Components, Test Scenarios
    3. Derive sub-sections from decision text + code scan:
       - Endpoints: grep code for routes/handlers matching this decision's domain
       - UI Components: grep code for pages/components matching this decision
       - Test Scenarios: infer 2-3 testable scenarios from decision text
    4. If decision is pure infra/config (no API/UI): write "none" for Endpoints/UI
    5. Do NOT invent endpoints that don't exist in code — only document what's built

## Generate API-CONTRACTS.md (if missing)

**Skip if:** API-CONTRACTS.md exists AND not --force. Also skip if --skip-contracts.

This reuses the existing blueprint contract generation logic, but targeted at an already-built phase.

**Key difference from blueprint:** blueprint generates contracts BEFORE code. Migrate generates contracts FROM existing code (reverse-engineering).

```
Agent(model="sonnet", description="Generate API-CONTRACTS.md from built code"):
  prompt: |
    Read skill: .claude/skills/api-contract/SKILL.md — Mode: Generate.
    
    Generate API-CONTRACTS.md for phase ${PHASE_NUMBER}.
    This phase was ALREADY BUILT — extract contracts from existing code, don't invent.
    
    Inputs:
    1. CONTEXT.md enriched decisions (Endpoints sub-sections)
    2. Actual route handler code at: ${config.code_patterns.api_routes}
    3. Contract format: ${config.contract_format.type}
    
    Process:
    1. Read CONTEXT.md → list endpoints mentioned in Endpoints sub-sections
    2. For each endpoint, grep actual route handler in codebase
    3. Extract: method, path, request schema (from validation), response shape, auth middleware, error codes
    4. Generate 4-block contract per endpoint (auth, schema, errors, sample)
    5. If code uses Zod: extract schema directly from code (don't reinvent)
    6. If code uses bare validation: create Zod schema matching the validation logic
    
    CRITICAL: This is REVERSE-ENGINEERING from code, not forward-design.
    Every field, every status code, every auth guard MUST match what's actually in the code.
    
    Output: write to ${PHASE_DIR}/API-CONTRACTS.md.staged (STAGING — not final).

```
Agent(model="sonnet", description="Generate TEST-GOALS.md from enriched CONTEXT"):

    2. API-CONTRACTS.md (if generated in step 5)
    3. Built code (verify goals are testable against actual implementation)
    
    Rules:
    1. Every decision with Test Scenarios → at least 1 goal
    2. Every endpoint in API-CONTRACTS.md → at least 1 goal
    3. Goals describe WHAT to verify, not HOW
    4. Priority assignment:
       - Auth/payment/security → critical
       - Data mutation (POST/PUT/DELETE) → important (min)
       - Read-only (GET) → important
       - Cosmetic/display → nice-to-have
    5. Each goal MUST have: success criteria, mutation evidence, dependencies
    6. Add `infra_deps` field if goal requires services not in this phase:
       ```
       **Infra deps:** [clickhouse, kafka, pixel-server, redis]
       ```
       Goals with unmet infra_deps auto-classify as INFRA_PENDING in review Phase 4.

    Write to: ${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS.md.staged (STAGING — not final).
    
    7. **MANDATORY for mutation goals (Rule 3b — blueprint enforcement):**
       Every goal có non-empty **Mutation evidence:** PHẢI có **Persistence check:** block:
       ```
       **Persistence check:**
       - Pre-submit: read <field/row/state> value
       - Action: <what user does>
       - Post-submit wait: API 2xx + toast
       - Refresh: page.reload() OR navigate away + back
       - Re-read: <where to re-read>
       - Assert: <field> = <new value> AND != <pre value>
       ```
       Skip Persistence check chỉ khi: read-only goal (no mutation), final-step wizard, file upload.
    
    8. **Surface classification REQUIRED** — mỗi goal có dòng `**Surface:** ui|api|data|integration|time-driven|custom`
       (review/test pipeline cần để pick runner — backend phase tránh deadlock browser scan)
