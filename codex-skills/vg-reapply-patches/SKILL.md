## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-reapply-patches`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.
</codex_skill_adapter>



<rules>
1. **Non-destructive** — never overwrite a target file unless user explicitly chose edit/keep-upstream for that entry.
2. **Manifest is source of truth** — iterate `.claude/vgflow-patches/.patches-manifest.json` entries; don't glob patches dir directly.
3. **Validate edit result** — after `$EDITOR` closes, reject resolution if conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`) still present.
4. **Atomic per entry** — update manifest only after the filesystem side (mv / rm / write target) succeeds.
5. **All marker math in Python** — no sed/awk regex games on conflict markers; use the inline Python helpers.
6. **Cleanup last** — delete `.claude/vgflow-patches/` only after the manifest is fully drained.
</rules>

<objective>
Drive an interactive resolution loop over every entry recorded in
`.claude/vgflow-patches/.patches-manifest.json` (created by `/vg:update`).
Each entry corresponds to `.claude/vgflow-patches/{rel}.conflict` — a
merged file still carrying `<<<<<<<` / `=======` / `>>>>>>>` markers from
`git merge-file`. The target install path is `.claude/{rel}` and at the
point this command runs still contains the user's pre-merge version
(because `/vg:update` parked the merged-with-markers copy and never
clobbered the target on conflict).

For each entry offer 4 resolutions:

- **[e] edit**   — open conflict file in `$EDITOR`, require no markers remain, then `mv` to target.
- **[k] keep upstream** — extract upstream side of each conflict block, write to target, remove conflict file.
- **[r] restore local** — discard upstream change; target is already local, just drop conflict file.
- **[s] skip**   — leave entry in manifest for a later run.

After the loop, if manifest is empty → `rm -rf .claude/vgflow-patches/`.
</objective>

<process>

<step name="0_mode_router">
**Mode router — T8 gate (cổng) integrity resolution vs legacy patch-conflict resolution.**

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--verify-gates`, drive interactive gate-integrity resolution over `${PLANNING_DIR}/vgflow-patches/gate-conflicts.md` (written by `/vg:update` v1.8.0+ when a 3-way merge (gộp) altered a hard gate block).

Otherwise, fall through to the legacy manifest-based patch resolution below.

```bash
set -u
MODE="patches"
case " $ARGUMENTS " in
  *" --verify-gates "*) MODE="verify-gates" ;;
esac
echo "mode (chế độ)=${MODE}"
```
</step>

<step name="0b_verify_gates_mode">
**Active only when `MODE=verify-gates`.** This step reads `gate-conflicts.md` (patches directory), offers an interactive per-conflict resolution walkthrough (upstream / merged / skip+flag / cancel), applies the choice, and — when all resolved — deletes the file so hard gates can trust their own logic again.

Resolutions (glossed):
- `[u] use upstream (dùng bản gốc)` — restore the canonical upstream block content.
- `[m] keep merged (giữ bản đã gộp)` — accept the merged-result block as-is (will still be re-hashed; persisting only if you explicitly accept risk).
- `[s] skip + flag manual (bỏ qua, gắn cờ để người kiểm tra)` — leave unresolved; caller must inspect manually.
- `[c] cancel (hủy)` — abort, keep everything as-is.

```bash
if [ "$MODE" != "verify-gates" ]; then
  echo "(skip verify-gates — running patches mode)"
fi

if [ "$MODE" = "verify-gates" ]; then
  REPO_ROOT="$(pwd)"
  CONFLICTS_MD="${REPO_ROOT}/${PLANNING_DIR}/vgflow-patches/gate-conflicts.md"
  DIFF_DIR="${REPO_ROOT}/${PLANNING_DIR}/vgflow-patches/gate-conflicts"

  if [ ! -f "$CONFLICTS_MD" ]; then
    echo "No gate-conflicts (xung đột cổng) found at ${CONFLICTS_MD}. Nothing to verify."
    exit 0
  fi

  # List conflict headings (## {command} :: {gate_id}) for the prompt loop
  REPO_ROOT="$REPO_ROOT" CONFLICTS_MD="$CONFLICTS_MD" python3 - <<'PY'
import os, re, sys
md = open(os.environ["CONFLICTS_MD"], encoding="utf-8").read()
blocks = re.findall(r'^##\s+([^\n]+)\s*\n(.*?)(?=^##\s|\Z)', md, flags=re.M|re.S)
print("FOUND={}".format(len(blocks)))
for title, body in blocks:
    print("---")
    print("TITLE: {}".format(title))
    for line in body.strip().splitlines()[:6]:
        print(" | " + line)
PY
fi
```

Then, for EACH conflict heading listed above, the Claude tool driver (not bash) should:

1. Read the per-gate unified diff from `${PLANNING_DIR}/vgflow-patches/gate-conflicts/{command}-{gate_id}.diff`.
2. Present the diff to the user via the `AskUserQuestion` tool with the 4 options `[u] use upstream` / `[m] keep merged` / `[s] skip+flag` / `[c] cancel`.
3. Apply the choice:
   - **`u`** — locate the gate block in `.claude/commands/vg/{command}.md` (using fingerprint from context), replace with the upstream block provided in the diff, emit telemetry `gate_integrity_conflict` with `outcome=RESOLVED_UPSTREAM`.
   - **`m`** — no file mutation; emit telemetry with `outcome=ACCEPTED_MERGED`, and append a `[manual-review]` marker line to `gate-conflicts.md` beside this entry so it stays visible in future `/vg:doctor` runs.
   - **`s`** — append `[skipped]` marker; do not clear the entry from `gate-conflicts.md`.
   - **`c`** — stop the loop; leave file untouched.
4. Record the resolution inline in `gate-conflicts.md` so the next run sees which entries are already handled.

When all entries carry one of {`[resolved-upstream]`, `[resolved-merged]`} markers (i.e. no `[skipped]` / unresolved headings remain), delete `gate-conflicts.md` and the sibling `gate-conflicts/` diff dir. Pipeline commands (`/vg:build`, `/vg:review`, `/vg:test`, `/vg:accept`) will unblock automatically.

```bash
if [ "$MODE" = "verify-gates" ]; then
  # Exit here — driver will loop via AskUserQuestion, then call this same
  # command again once all resolutions marked, and the file-exists check
  # naturally short-circuits.
  exit 0
fi
```
