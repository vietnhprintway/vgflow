## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Runtime lock

When this skill is running inside Codex, DO NOT switch to Claude CLI to execute
the workflow entrypoint. Keep the current Codex runtime, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`, use Codex `update_plan` for the compact visible task
window, and bind it with `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter codex`.

VGFlow source paths are resolved through global `VG_HOME` (default:
`~/.vgflow`). Project-local Claude workflow files may be absent in global-only
installs; Codex must use `${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}`
and `${VG_COMMAND_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/commands/vg}` for workflow
helpers. References below to "Claude CLI", `TodoWrite`, or Haiku describe the
Claude adapter only. Codex must map them through this adapter contract instead
of aborting the current run and relaunching Claude.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Compact Codex plan window + orchestrator step markers | Use `tasklist-contract.json` as source of truth. Do not paste the full hierarchy into Codex `update_plan`. Show at most 6 rows: active group/step first, next 2-3 pending steps, completed groups collapsed, and `+N pending`. After projecting, emit `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter codex`. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

<HARD-GATE-CODEX>
Codex has no PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks. Claude Code's `vg-step-tracker.py`
hook auto-emits `must_touch_markers` declared in `commands/vg/review.md`;
Codex does NOT receive that signal. AI MUST emit each HARD marker manually
after the corresponding STEP's primary action completes — failure to do so
causes the contract validator to reject the run with "8/N markers found".

After each STEP's primary action completes, run:

```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review <marker>
```

Required HARD markers for /vg:review (v2.65.0 A9):

| STEP | Marker |
|---|---|
| Pre-STEP 0 (integrity precheck) | `00_gate_integrity_precheck` |
| STEP 0 (parse + validate) | `0_parse_and_validate` |
| STEP 0b (goal coverage gate) | `0b_goal_coverage_gate` |
| Final close | `complete` |

The remaining markers in `must_touch_markers:` (phase1_*, phase2_*, phaseP_*,
crossai_review, write_artifacts, bootstrap_reflection, env-mode-gate, etc.)
are advisory (severity: warn) or flag-gated; emit them when the matching
profile branch executes.

v2.67.0 #158 — lens telemetry parity: the body below explicitly calls
`mark-step review 2b3_lens_dispatch_complete` and
`mark-step review 2b3_lens_matrix_rendered` after the matching steps so
Codex matches the Claude PostToolUse hook's marker coverage on the
LENS-DISPATCH-PLAN.json + LENS-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md must_write artifacts.
</HARD-GATE-CODEX>

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash "${VG_COMMAND_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/commands/vg}/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh" \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-review`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.

</LANGUAGE_POLICY>

### Tasklist projection (REQUIRED before any step-active)

Read `_shared/lib/tasklist-projection-instruction.md` and follow it
verbatim. The PreToolUse-bash hook will BLOCK every `step-active` call
in this slim entry until `.vg/runs/${RUN_ID}/.tasklist-projected.evidence.json`
exists.

Claude TodoWrite MUST include sub-items (`↳` prefix) for each group header;
flat projection (group-headers only) is rejected by PostToolUse depth
check (Task 44b Rule V2).

Codex MUST keep the visible plan compact. Do not paste the full hierarchy
into Codex `update_plan`; use `codex_plan_window` from the contract and show
at most 6 rows: active group/step first, next 2-3 pending steps, completed
groups collapsed, and `+N pending`.

<TASKLIST_POLICY>
**Native task UI projection is REQUIRED.**

Source of truth:
1. `.vg/runs/{run_id}/tasklist-contract.json` — canonical checklist for this run.
2. `.vg/events.db` — `review.tasklist_shown`, `review.native_tasklist_projected`, `step.active`, `step.marked`.
3. `${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/...` — durable completion markers.

Provider adapters:
- **Claude CLI:** use native Claude tasklist projection. Prefer `TodoWrite`
  with the full two-layer hierarchy from `projection_items[]`; each todo
  `content` MUST start with the contract checklist/step id or title. If this
  Claude runtime exposes `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, that adapter is also
  acceptable. Do not create ad-hoc todos outside `tasklist-contract.json`.
- **Codex CLI:** project only a compact plan window from `codex_plan_window`;
  preserve current active group/step identity, but do not create one visible
  item per `projection_items[]` row. Update the compact window before/after
  each step and keep it at 6 visible rows or fewer.
- **Fallback:** only if the runtime exposes no native task UI, use `vg-orchestrator run-status --pretty` before and after each step and record adapter `fallback`.

Lifecycle:
- `replace-on-start`: the first native projection MUST replace any stale task
  list from a previous workflow. Never append current review items onto a
  previous workflow's list.
- `close-on-complete`: before reporting success, mark all review checklist
  items completed. Then clear the native list if supported; otherwise replace
  it with one completed sentinel item: `vg:review phase ${PHASE_NUMBER} complete`.

Mandatory binding:
1. After `emit-tasklist.py` prints the taskboard and `Tasklist contract: ...`, read that contract.
2. Project to the runtime-native task UI before phase execution continues:
   Claude full hierarchy; Codex compact window only.
3. Immediately call:
   ```bash
   "${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" tasklist-projected --adapter auto
   # auto locks to claude, codex, or fallback from runtime env
   ```
4. At each step start, update the native UI to show the active step and call `vg-orchestrator step-active <step_name>`.
5. At each step end, write the marker, update the native UI to show completion, and call `vg-orchestrator mark-step review <step_name>`.

Do not improvise a separate checklist. The native UI is a projection of `tasklist-contract.json`; the harness contract remains authoritative.

Long-running work still needs visible narration: run Bash jobs over 30s in background and poll with `BashOutput`; summarize Task subagent progress before and after spawning.

**Dynamic sub-task append (RULE)** — projection từ emit-tasklist là baseline,
KHÔNG cứng. Khi AI execute group/step phức tạp (e.g. `phase2_browser_discovery`
với nhiều view, `phase2_5_recursive_lens_probe` với nhiều lens), AI PHẢI append
child todos vào group đó để user thấy real-time progress.

Pattern for Claude native task UI (tolerant hook B11.6+):
- Initial: 1 todo per group header
- During execution: TodoWrite update — keep group header, append children
  với title `  ↳ <id>: <one-line desc>` (status: pending → in_progress → completed)
- Examples cho review:
  - `  ↳ View /campaigns: 12 actions captured`
  - `  ↳ Lens lens-modal-state: 3 modals probed (1 BLOCKED — focus trap)`
  - `  ↳ phase2c G-04: enriched with success criteria`

Cho operator visibility "AI sẽ làm gì tiếp / tiến độ tới đâu" mà không phải
đọc Bash log dài.

Codex exception: keep these dynamic details folded into the active compact
plan row or the next row. Do not exceed the 6-row `codex_plan_window` budget.

**Translate English terms (RULE)** — output có thuật ngữ tiếng Anh PHẢI thêm giải thích VN trong dấu ngoặc tại lần đầu xuất hiện. Tham khảo `_shared/term-glossary.md`. Ví dụ: `BLOCK (chặn)`, `Foundation (nền tảng) drift detected (phát hiện lệch hướng)`, `legacy-v1 (định dạng cũ v1)`, `UNREACHABLE (không tiếp cận được)`. Không áp dụng: file path, code identifier (`D-XX`, `git`, `pnpm`), config tag values, lần lặp lại trong cùng message.
</TASKLIST_POLICY>

<rules>
1. **Phase profile drives prerequisites (P5, v1.9.2)** — `detect_phase_profile` chooses WHICH artifacts are required:
   - `feature` (default) → SPECS + CONTEXT + PLAN + API-CONTRACTS + TEST-GOALS + SUMMARY
   - `infra` → SPECS + PLAN + SUMMARY (no TEST-GOALS, no API-CONTRACTS — goals from SPECS success_criteria)
   - `hotfix` / `bugfix` → SPECS + PLAN + SUMMARY (reuse parent goals or issue ref)
   - `migration` → SPECS + PLAN + SUMMARY + ROLLBACK
   - `docs` → SPECS only
   Missing required artifact → BLOCK via `block_resolve` (L2 architect proposal), NOT anti-pattern "list 3 options".
2. **Review mode branches on profile** — `feature=full` (browser + surfaces) | `infra=infra-smoke` (parse + run success_criteria bash) | `hotfix=delta` | `bugfix=regression` | `migration=schema-verify` | `docs=link-check`.
3. **Discovery-first** — AI explores the running app organically. No hardcoded checklists. No pre-scripted paths.
4. **Bấm → Nhìn → List → Đánh giá** — at every view: snapshot, evaluate data + actions, click each, observe result.
5. **Fix in review, verify in test** — review handles discovery + fix. Test handles clean goal verification only.
6. **RUNTIME-MAP is ground truth** — produced from actual browser interaction, not code guessing.
7. **Flexible format** — AI chooses best representation per page (tree, list, flow). No mandated table structure.
8. **Exploration limits (hard-enforced, v1.14.4+)** — max 50 actions/view, 200 total, 30 min wall time. Counted by `phase2_exploration_limits` step after discovery. Threshold breach → WARN + log to PIPELINE-STATE.json metrics (not block; discovery already done, but signals noisy RUNTIME-MAP). Thresholds overridable via `config.review.max_actions_per_view|max_actions_total|max_wall_minutes`.
9. **Zero hardcode** — no endpoint, role, page name, or project-specific value in this workflow. All values from config or runtime observation.
10. **Profile enforcement (UNIVERSAL)** — every `<step>` MUST, as FINAL action:
    `touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/{STEP_NAME}.done"`.
    `create_task_tracker` preflight runs filter-steps.py to count expected steps for `$PROFILE`.
    Browser-based steps (phase 2 discovery) carry `profile="web-fullstack,web-frontend-only"` — skipped for backend-only/cli/library.
11. **Resume model (v1.14.4+)** — no mid-phase-2 resume. Step-level idempotency via `.step-markers/*.done` + per-view atomic `scan-*.json` is sufficient. If discovery dies mid-run, re-run `/vg:review {phase}` from scratch OR `/vg:review {phase} --retry-failed` (requires RUNTIME-MAP already written).
12. **Post-build test-spec gate (v3.6.7)** — first full review requires `/vg:test-spec {phase}` artifacts (`DEEP-TEST-SPECS.md`, `LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json`, `TEST-FIXTURE-DAG.json`, `TEST-EXECUTION-PLAN.json`, `TEST-SPEC-LOCALIZER/PROMPT.md`, `PLAYWRIGHT-SPEC-PLAN.md`). Review consumes them as the lifecycle contract; it does not invent deep test specs late.
</rules>

<objective>
Step 4 of V5.1 pipeline. Replaces old "audit" step. Combines static code scan + live browser discovery + iterative fix loop + goal comparison.

Pipeline: specs → scope → blueprint → build → test-spec → **review** → test → accept

4 Phases:
- Phase 1: CODE SCAN — grep contracts + count elements (fast, automated, <10 sec)
- Phase 2: BROWSER DISCOVERY — MCP Playwright organic exploration → RUNTIME-MAP
- Phase 3: FIX LOOP — errors found → fix → redeploy → re-discover (max 3 iterations)
- Phase 4: GOAL COMPARISON — map TEST-GOALS to discovered paths → weighted gate
</objective>

<process>

**Config:** Read `${VG_COMMAND_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/commands/vg}/_shared/config-loader.md` first.

**Bug detection (v1.11.2 R6 — MANDATORY):** Read `${VG_COMMAND_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/commands/vg}/_shared/bug-detection-guide.md` BEFORE starting. Apply 6 detection patterns throughout: schema_violation, helper_error, user_pushback, ai_inconsistency, gate_loop, self_discovery. When detected: NARRATE intent + CALL `report_bug` via bash + CONTINUE workflow (non-blocking).

<CRITICAL_MCP_RULE>
**BEFORE any browser interaction**, you MUST run the Playwright lock claim:
```bash
SESSION_ID="vg-${PHASE}-review-$$"
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER=$(bash "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" claim "$SESSION_ID")
# Auto-release lock on exit (normal/error/interrupt). Prevents leak if process dies mid-scan.
trap "bash '${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh' release \"$SESSION_ID\" 2>/dev/null" EXIT INT TERM
```
Then use `mcp__${PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER}__` as prefix for ALL browser tool calls.

**NEVER call `plugin:playwright:playwright` directly.** Other sessions (Codex, other tabs) may be using it.
If claim returns `playwright3`, your tools are `mcp__playwright3__browser_navigate`, `mcp__playwright3__browser_snapshot`, etc.
If ALL 5 servers locked → BLOCK. The lock manager auto-sweeps stale locks (TTL 1800s + dead-PID check)
on every claim — if still no slot free, it's genuinely contended. Do NOT manually cleanup other sessions' locks.
</CRITICAL_MCP_RULE>

### Pre-STEP — integrity precheck (HARD)

Before any other STEP runs, the canonical command body's preflight invokes
the integrity precheck. On Codex, after the precheck completes, emit:

```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review 00_gate_integrity_precheck
```

### Preflight section (extracted v2.70.0)

Read `_shared/review/preflight.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 7 steps: 00_gate_integrity_precheck, 00_session_lifecycle, 0_parse_and_validate, 0a_env_mode_gate, 0b_goal_coverage_gate, 0c_telemetry_suggestions, create_task_tracker.

After preflight's primary actions complete (args parsed, env-mode gate satisfied,
goal coverage gate green, task tracker emitted), emit the HARD markers manually
(Codex hook fallback):

```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review 0_parse_and_validate
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review 0b_goal_coverage_gate
```

WARN markers (`00_session_lifecycle`, `0a_env_mode_gate`,
`0c_telemetry_suggestions`, `create_task_tracker`) are advisory — emit when the
matching code path runs, but missing them does not fail the contract.

### Phase profile branch (Section 2 — extracted v2.70.0)

Read `_shared/review/phase-p-variants.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 6 steps: phase_profile_branch, phaseP_infra_smoke, phaseP_delta, phaseP_regression, phaseP_schema_verify, phaseP_link_check.

phaseP_* markers are flag-gated; emit only when the matching profile branch
executes (e.g. `phaseP_delta` for `--mode delta`, `phaseP_infra_smoke` for
`--mode infra-smoke`).

### Code scan section (extracted v2.70.0 T3)

Read `_shared/review/code-scan.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 2 steps: phase1_code_scan, phase1_5_ripple_and_god_node.

After code scan + ripple/god-node analysis complete, emit:

```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review phase1_code_scan
```

### API contract probe + browser discovery (extracted v2.70.0 T4)

Read `_shared/review/api-and-discovery.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 2 steps: phase2a_api_contract_probe, phase2_browser_discovery.

CODEX NOTE: For browser discovery, the main Codex orchestrator owns
Playwright MCP; do NOT spawn `codex exec` for MCP-heavy work. After API
probe + browser discovery complete, emit:

```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review phase2a_api_contract_probe
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review phase2_browser_discovery
```

### Lens probe + findings derivation (extracted v2.70.0 T5)

Read `_shared/review/lens-and-findings.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 8 steps: phase2_5_recursive_lens_probe, phase2b_collect_merge, phase2c_enrich_test_goals, phase2c_pre_dispatch_gates, phase2d_crud_roundtrip_dispatch, phase2e_findings_merge, phase2e_post_challenge, phase2f_route_auto_fix.

After LENS-DISPATCH-PLAN.json + LENS-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md must_write artifacts
land, emit (v2.67.0 #158 lens telemetry parity — matches Claude PostToolUse
hook's marker coverage):

```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review 2b3_lens_dispatch_complete
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review 2b3_lens_matrix_rendered
```

### Exploration limits + mobile + visual checks (extracted v2.70.0 T6)

Read `_shared/review/limits-and-mobile.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 4 steps: phase2_exploration_limits, phase2_mobile_discovery, phase2_5_visual_checks, phase2_5_mobile_visual_checks.

Mobile/visual markers are profile-gated (`mobile-*` profile for mobile
discovery, `web-fullstack`/`web-frontend-only` for visual checks). Emit only
when the matching profile branch executes.

### URL state + error message runtime (extracted v2.70.0 T7)

Read `_shared/review/url-and-error.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 3 steps: phase2_7_url_state_sync, phase2_8_url_state_runtime, phase2_9_error_message_runtime.

These steps are `web-fullstack,web-frontend-only` profile-gated. Emit when
matching profile branch executes; advisory severity (warn).

### Fix loop + goal comparison (extracted v2.70.0 T8 — largest section)

Read `_shared/review/fix-loop-and-goals.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 2 steps: phase3_fix_loop (max 5 iterations), phase4_goal_comparison.

CODEX NOTE: For fix loop, source `Agent(...)` calls map to
`codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` (per
codex_spawn_precedence table above — `/vg:review` fix agents). After fix loop
+ goal comparison complete, emit:

```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review phase3_fix_loop
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review phase4_goal_comparison
```

### Close section (extracted v2.70.0 T9 — final extraction)

Read `_shared/review/close.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 5 steps: unreachable_triage, crossai_review, write_artifacts, bootstrap_reflection, complete.

After write_artifacts persists RUNTIME-MAP.json + GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md and
crossai_review consensus completes (final-wave only), emit the HARD markers
+ run-complete:

```bash
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review crossai_review
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review write_artifacts
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step review complete
```

The terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` MUST be called by `_shared/review/close.md`;
on non-zero exit, fix evidence and retry per Stop hook parity contract above.

<success_criteria>
- Code scan completed (contract verify + element inventory)
- Browser discovery explored all reachable views organically
- RUNTIME-MAP.json produced with actual runtime observations (canonical JSON)
- RUNTIME-MAP.md derived from JSON (human-readable)
- Fix loop resolved code bugs (if any)
- TEST-GOALS mapped to discovered paths
- GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md shows weighted goal readiness
- Gate passed (weighted: 100% critical, 80% important, 50% nice-to-have)
- Discovery state saved (resumable)
