## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Markdown progress + step markers | Do not rely on Claude's persistent task tail UI. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Do NOT blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-review`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.

<NARRATION_POLICY>
**⛔ DO NOT USE TodoWrite / TaskCreate / TaskUpdate in this command.**

Why: those tools persist items in Claude Code's status tail across sessions. If a long step (Haiku scanner, Bash, Task subagent) interrupts before items get marked completed, they hang forever in the UI ("Phase 2b-1: Navigator", "Start pnpm dev + wait health" stuck for runs after).

**Use these instead:**
1. **Markdown headers in YOUR text output** between tool calls — e.g., `## ━━━ Phase 2b-1: Navigator ━━━` written in plain text. Appears in message stream, does NOT persist after session ends.
2. **`run_in_background: true` for any Bash > 30s** (dev server boot, health wait, parallel scanner spawn). Then poll with `BashOutput` so user sees stdout live instead of waiting blind.
3. **For Task subagents** that take > 2 min: write a 1-line status in your text output BEFORE spawning ("Spawning Haiku scanner for /users + /settings..."), then a 1-line summary AFTER it returns ("Scanner found 12 elements, 0 errors"). User sees both in the message stream.
4. **Bash echo narration** (`narrate_phase`, `session_start` banner) lands in tool result block — useful for audit log but NOT visible during long runs. Don't rely on it as primary progress signal.
5. **Translate English terms (RULE)** — output có thuật ngữ tiếng Anh PHẢI thêm giải thích VN trong dấu ngoặc tại lần đầu xuất hiện. Tham khảo `_shared/term-glossary.md`. Ví dụ: `BLOCK (chặn)`, `Foundation (nền tảng) drift detected (phát hiện lệch hướng)`, `legacy-v1 (định dạng cũ v1)`, `UNREACHABLE (không tiếp cận được)`. Không áp dụng: file path, code identifier (`D-XX`, `git`, `pnpm`), config tag values, lần lặp lại trong cùng message.

This is a HARD rule — TodoWrite is the wrong abstraction for a 30-min orchestrator with parallel subagents.
</NARRATION_POLICY>

<rules>
1. **Phase profile drives prerequisites (P5, v1.9.2)** — `detect_phase_profile` chooses WHICH artifacts are required:
   - `feature` (default) → SPECS + CONTEXT + PLAN + API-CONTRACTS + TEST-GOALS + SUMMARY
   - `infra` → SPECS + PLAN + SUMMARY (no TEST-GOALS, no API-CONTRACTS — goals from SPECS success_criteria)
   - `hotfix` / `bugfix` → SPECS + PLAN + SUMMARY (reuse parent goals or issue ref)
   - `migration` → SPECS + PLAN + SUMMARY + ROLLBACK
   - `docs` → SPECS only
   Missing required artifact → BLOCK via `block_resolve` (L2 architect proposal), NOT anti-pattern "list 3 options".
2. **Review mode branches on profile** — `feature=full` (browser + surfaces) | `infra=infra-smoke` (parse + run success_criteria bash) | `hotfix=delta` | `bugfix=regression` | `migration=schema-verify` | `docs=link-check`.
3. **Discovery-first** — AI explores the running app organically. No hardcoded checklists. No pre-scripted paths.
4. **Bấm → Nhìn → List → Đánh giá** — at every view: snapshot, evaluate data + actions, click each, observe result.
5. **Fix in review, verify in test** — review handles discovery + fix. Test handles clean goal verification only.
6. **RUNTIME-MAP is ground truth** — produced from actual browser interaction, not code guessing.
7. **Flexible format** — AI chooses best representation per page (tree, list, flow). No mandated table structure.
8. **Exploration limits (hard-enforced, v1.14.4+)** — max 50 actions/view, 200 total, 30 min wall time. Counted by `phase2_exploration_limits` step after discovery. Threshold breach → WARN + log to PIPELINE-STATE.json metrics (not block; discovery already done, but signals noisy RUNTIME-MAP). Thresholds overridable via `config.review.max_actions_per_view|max_actions_total|max_wall_minutes`.
9. **Zero hardcode** — no endpoint, role, page name, or project-specific value in this workflow. All values from config or runtime observation.
10. **Profile enforcement (UNIVERSAL)** — every `<step>` MUST, as FINAL action:
    `touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/{STEP_NAME}.done"`.
    `create_task_tracker` preflight runs filter-steps.py to count expected steps for `$PROFILE`.
    Browser-based steps (phase 2 discovery) carry `profile="web-fullstack,web-frontend-only"` — skipped for backend-only/cli/library.
11. **Resume model (v1.14.4+)** — no mid-phase-2 resume. Step-level idempotency via `.step-markers/*.done` + per-view atomic `scan-*.json` is sufficient. If discovery dies mid-run, re-run `/vg:review {phase}` from scratch OR `/vg:review {phase} --retry-failed` (requires RUNTIME-MAP already written).
</rules>

<objective>
Step 4 of V5.1 pipeline. Replaces old "audit" step. Combines static code scan + live browser discovery + iterative fix loop + goal comparison.

Pipeline: specs → scope → blueprint → build → **review** → test → accept

4 Phases:
- Phase 1: CODE SCAN — grep contracts + count elements (fast, automated, <10 sec)
- Phase 2: BROWSER DISCOVERY — MCP Playwright organic exploration → RUNTIME-MAP
- Phase 3: FIX LOOP — errors found → fix → redeploy → re-discover (max 3 iterations)
- Phase 4: GOAL COMPARISON — map TEST-GOALS to discovered paths → weighted gate
</objective>

<process>

**Config:** Read .claude/commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md first.

**Bug detection (v1.11.2 R6 — MANDATORY):** Read `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/bug-detection-guide.md` BEFORE starting. Apply 6 detection patterns throughout: schema_violation, helper_error, user_pushback, ai_inconsistency, gate_loop, self_discovery. When detected: NARRATE intent + CALL `report_bug` via bash + CONTINUE workflow (non-blocking).

<CRITICAL_MCP_RULE>
**BEFORE any browser interaction**, you MUST run the Playwright lock claim:
```bash
SESSION_ID="vg-${PHASE}-review-$$"
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER=$(bash "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" claim "$SESSION_ID")
# Auto-release lock on exit (normal/error/interrupt). Prevents leak if process dies mid-scan.
trap "bash '${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh' release \"$SESSION_ID\" 2>/dev/null" EXIT INT TERM
```
Then use `mcp__${PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER}__` as prefix for ALL browser tool calls.

**NEVER call `plugin:playwright:playwright` directly.** Other sessions (Codex, other tabs) may be using it.
If claim returns `playwright3`, your tools are `mcp__playwright3__browser_navigate`, `mcp__playwright3__browser_snapshot`, etc.
If ALL 5 servers locked → BLOCK. The lock manager auto-sweeps stale locks (TTL 1800s + dead-PID check)
on every claim — if still no slot free, it's genuinely contended. Do NOT manually cleanup other sessions' locks.
</CRITICAL_MCP_RULE>

<step name="00_gate_integrity_precheck">
**T8 gate (cổng) integrity precheck — blocks review if /vg:update left unresolved gate conflicts (xung đột).**

If `${PLANNING_DIR}/vgflow-patches/gate-conflicts.md` exists, a prior `/vg:update` detected that the 3-way merge (gộp) altered one or more HARD gate blocks. BLOCK (chặn) until resolved via `/vg:reapply-patches --verify-gates`.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`: phase_number, flags.

Flags:
- `--skip-scan` — skip Phase 1 (code scan), go directly to browser discovery. **Gated**: must pair with `--override-reason="<text>"` (logged to override-debt).
- `--skip-discovery` — skip Phase 2 (browser discovery), use existing RUNTIME-MAP for Phase 4. **Gated**: must pair with `--override-reason="<text>"` (logged to override-debt).
- `--fix-only` — skip to Phase 3 (requires RUNTIME-MAP with errors). **Gated**: listed in `forbidden_without_override` (line 34) — must combine with `--override-reason="<text>"` to run, otherwise hard BLOCK. Entry logged to override-debt register.
- `--skip-crossai` — skip CrossAI review at end
- `--evaluate-only` — skip Phase 1 + 2 (discovery already done by Codex/Gemini), read existing scan JSONs from ${PHASE_DIR}, go directly to Phase 2b-3 (collect + merge) → Phase 3 (fix) → Phase 4 (goal comparison). Requires: nav-discovery.json + scan-*.json already exist.
- `--retry-failed` — skip Phase 1 + Phase 2 navigator, re-scan ONLY views mapped to failed/blocked goals in GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md. Requires: GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md + RUNTIME-MAP.json already exist. Use when: review already ran but goals < 100%, code was fixed, need targeted re-scan without full re-discovery.
- `--full-scan` — disable sidebar suppression. Haiku agents see full page (sidebar/header/footer) in every snapshot. Use when: app has non-standard layout, geometry detection fails, or debugging suppression issues.
- `--with-probes` — enable mutation probe variations (edit/boundary/repeat) in step 2b-3 step 9. Adds 1 Haiku per mutation goal. Default OFF — let /vg:test handle variations via Playwright codegen (deterministic, cheaper).
- `--allow-no-crud-surface` — last-resort waiver for legacy phases missing CRUD-SURFACES.md. Logs debt via validator output; do not use for new CRUD work.

<step name="0a_env_mode_gate">
## Step 0a — Confirm review env + mode + scanner (v2.42.1+ — HARD gate)

**Background:** Pre-v2.42, review used `config.step_env.verify` silently. User had no visibility. Phases 3.3/3.4a/3.4b needed re-runs because env wasn't pinned. v2.42 added prompt with `severity: warn` — AI skipped it. v2.42.1 makes this a HARD block (severity: block default + telemetry required).

**This step makes env+mode+scanner user-visible + recorded BEFORE any other work happens.**

### ⛔ MANDATORY FIRST ACTION (before ANY other tool call in this step)

**STOP. The very first thing you do in step `0a_env_mode_gate` is invoke `AskUserQuestion`** with the 3-question payload below — no exceptions other than the documented waivers.

**Skip AskUserQuestion ONLY when:**
- `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--non-interactive` flag, OR
- `VG_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` env var is set, OR
- `$ARGUMENTS` contains ALL THREE: `--target-env=<v>` (or `--sandbox`/`--local`/`--staging`/`--prod`), `--mode=<v>`, and `--scanner=<v>`

If ANY of the 3 axes is missing on CLI and not waived → AskUserQuestion is REQUIRED. Do NOT silently default. Do NOT run the bash block below before the AskUserQuestion call returns.

**Why HARD gate (v2.42.1):** AI agents have a strong pull to silent-default in `warn` severity contracts. Phases 3.3/3.4a/3.4b confirmed this. Block severity + telemetry-required closes the gap.

### AskUserQuestion payload (3 questions, single batched call)

**Downstream impact:**
- Phase 1 / Phase 2 / Phase 2.5 / Phase 3 / Phase 4 all read `$ENV_NAME` and `$REVIEW_MODE` — no further changes needed; they pick up user choice automatically.
- `phaseP_*` profile branches (line 528+) gate on `$REVIEW_MODE` — user can override auto-detected profile mode here.
- `$VG_SCANNER` is recorded into PIPELINE-STATE.json + telemetry. **Banner echoes the choice at start of phase1_code_scan** so user sees the value was honored. **Supplemental CrossAI CLI scan (codex-supplement / gemini-supplement / council-all) is wired in v2.42.2** — a follow-up patch lands the actual `codex exec` / `gemini` / Claude CLI dispatch after Haiku completes, plus merge into RUNTIME-MAP under `crossai_scanner_findings`. v2.42.1 captures the user choice so the data path is in place.
- Re-running `/vg:review <phase>` re-prompts (audit trail accumulates `last_invoked_at` history).

<step name="0b_goal_coverage_gate">
**ADVISORY GATE (v2.2+) — warn on unbound automated goals, but don't BLOCK at review stage.**

Rationale: tests land in /vg:test (creates .spec.ts with TS-XX markers). Review runs BEFORE /vg:test → first-pass review always fails goal coverage → pipeline deadlock on backend-only phases.

Fix (v2.2+): at review stage = WARN only. At /vg:test + /vg:accept stages = BLOCK (those are the right enforcement points).

Per NARRATION_POLICY: review can spawn 5-20 Haiku scanners running in parallel (30+ min total). TaskCreate items would persist forever in Claude Code tail UI if the session interrupts mid-scan. Instead:

1. Write this block verbatim in your text output before starting phase 1 so user sees the plan:
   ```
   ## ━━━ /vg:review step plan ━━━
   1a:   Contract verify (grep BE routes vs contracts)
   1b:   Element inventory (count UI elements per file)
   1.5:  Graphify ripple analysis (cross-module callers)
   2a:   Deploy + preflight (to {ENV}, health check)
   2b-1: Navigator discovers views (Haiku scanning sidebar)
   2b-2: Haiku scanners per view (N parallel agents)
   2b-3: Merge + evaluate scan results
   2.5:  Visual integrity checks
   3:    Fix loop (max 3 iterations)
   4a:   Load goals + filter infra deps
   4b:   Map goals to RUNTIME-MAP
   4c:   Weighted gate evaluation
   4d:   Write GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX

## Review mode: delta (P5, v1.9.2 — OHOK Batch 2 B5: real verification)

**Runs when `REVIEW_MODE=delta` (hotfix profile).**

**Previous behavior (performative):** wrote "Verdict: PASS" stub without actually verifying hotfix touches parent failures. Hotfix could ship completely untested. OHOK Batch 2 B5 replaces stub with per-goal verification loop.

Logic: hotfix patches a parent phase. Review MUST:
- (a) Find parent's failed/blocked goals in GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX
- (b) For each failed goal, check if hotfix commits touch files that were implicated in the failure (via commit paths ∩ parent phase commits for that goal)
- (c) Fail build if any critical failed goal is NOT covered by hotfix delta — ship would regress

### 1a: Contract Verify (grep)

Read `.claude/skills/api-contract/SKILL.md` — Mode: Verify-Grep.
Read `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/env-commands.md` — contract_verify_grep(phase_dir, "both").

Run contract_verify_grep against `$SCAN_PATTERNS` paths from config:
- BE routes vs API-CONTRACTS.md endpoints
- FE API calls vs API-CONTRACTS.md endpoints

Result:
- 0 mismatches → PASS
- Mismatches → WARNING (not block — browser discovery will confirm)

### 1b: Element Inventory (grep — reference data, NOT gate)

Count UI elements using `$SCAN_PATTERNS` from config:

```
For each source file matching config.code_patterns.web_pages:
  Run element_count(file) from env-commands.md
  → uses SCAN_PATTERNS keys (modals, tables, forms, actions, etc.)
```

Write `${PHASE_DIR}/element-counts.json` — **reference data** for discovery (not a gate).

### 1c: i18n Key Resolution Check (config-gated)

**Skip conditions:**
- `config.i18n.enabled` is false or absent → skip entirely
- `config.i18n.locale_dir` is empty → skip

**Purpose:** Verify every i18n key used in phase-changed FE files actually resolves to a
translation string. Missing keys = user sees raw key like `dashboard.title` instead of text.

```bash
I18N_ENABLED="${config.i18n.enabled:-false}"
if [ "$I18N_ENABLED" = "true" ]; then
  LOCALE_DIR="${config.i18n.locale_dir}"
  DEFAULT_LOCALE="${config.i18n.default_locale:-en}"
  KEY_FN="${config.i18n.key_function:-t}"

  # Get FE files changed in this phase
  CHANGED_FE=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~${COMMIT_COUNT:-5} HEAD -- "${config.code_patterns.web_pages}" 2>/dev/null)

  if [ -n "$CHANGED_FE" ] && [ -d "$LOCALE_DIR" ]; then
    # Extract all i18n keys from changed files
    I18N_KEYS=$(echo "$CHANGED_FE" | xargs grep -ohE "${KEY_FN}\(['\"]([^'\"]+)['\"]\)" 2>/dev/null | \
      grep -oE "['\"][^'\"]+['\"]" | tr -d "'" | tr -d '"' | sort -u)

    # Check each key resolves in default locale file
    LOCALE_FILE=$(find "$LOCALE_DIR" -path "*/${DEFAULT_LOCALE}*" -name "*.json" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
    MISSING_KEYS=0

    if [ -n "$LOCALE_FILE" ] && [ -n "$I18N_KEYS" ]; then
      while IFS= read -r KEY; do
        [ -z "$KEY" ] && continue
        # Check key exists in JSON (dot-path → nested lookup)
        EXISTS=$(${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
import json, sys
from pathlib import Path
data = json.loads(Path('$LOCALE_FILE').read_text())
keys = '$KEY'.split('.')
ref = data
for k in keys:
    if isinstance(ref, dict) and k in ref:
        ref = ref[k]
    else:
        print('MISSING')
        sys.exit(0)
print('OK')
" 2>/dev/null)
        if [ "$EXISTS" = "MISSING" ]; then
          echo "  WARN: i18n key '$KEY' not found in ${LOCALE_FILE}"
          MISSING_KEYS=$((MISSING_KEYS + 1))
        fi
      done <<< "$I18N_KEYS"
    fi

    echo "i18n check: $(echo "$I18N_KEYS" | wc -l) keys, ${MISSING_KEYS} missing"
  fi
fi
```

Result routing: `MISSING_KEYS > 0` → GAPS_FOUND (not block — may be added in later commit).

Display:
```
Phase 1 Code Scan:
  Contract verify: {PASS|WARNING — N mismatches}
  Element inventory: {N} files, ~{M} interactive elements
  i18n key check: {N keys checked, M missing|skipped (disabled)}
  (Reference data for Phase 2 — not a gate)
```

### 1d: Override Debt Auto-Resolve (v2.7 Phase M extension)

When phase1_code_scan completes with no scan-driven regression (contract verify
PASS or WARNING-only, i18n missing-keys treated as non-blocking), the 5
Phase-M gate_ids on the supported list can auto-resolve any matching prior
debt entries from earlier phases.

The skip-when-current-phase-also-uses-flag guard mirrors the v2.6.1 accept.md
pattern: never resolve a gate_id whose flag is being used right now.

```bash
source "${REPO_ROOT}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/override-debt.sh" 2>/dev/null || true
if type -t override_auto_resolve_clean_run >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  RESOLUTION_EVENT_ID="review-clean-${PHASE_NUMBER}-$(date -u +%s)"
  if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --allow-orthogonal-hotfix ]]; then
    override_auto_resolve_clean_run "allow-orthogonal-hotfix" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
      "${RESOLUTION_EVENT_ID}" 2>&1 | sed 's/^/  /'
  fi
  if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --allow-no-bugref ]]; then
    override_auto_resolve_clean_run "allow-no-bugref" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
      "${RESOLUTION_EVENT_ID}" 2>&1 | sed 's/^/  /'
  fi
  if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --allow-empty-hotfix ]]; then
    override_auto_resolve_clean_run "allow-empty-hotfix" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
      "${RESOLUTION_EVENT_ID}" 2>&1 | sed 's/^/  /'
  fi
  if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --allow-empty-bugfix ]]; then
    override_auto_resolve_clean_run "allow-empty-bugfix" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
      "${RESOLUTION_EVENT_ID}" 2>&1 | sed 's/^/  /'
  fi
  if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --allow-unresolved-overrides ]]; then
    override_auto_resolve_clean_run "allow-unresolved-overrides" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
      "${RESOLUTION_EVENT_ID}" 2>&1 | sed 's/^/  /'
  fi
fi
```

The helper emits one `override.auto_resolved` audit event per gate_id that
matched at least one OPEN debt entry from a prior phase (R9: gate_id +
timestamp + git_sha). No-op when there are no matching entries.

<step name="phase1_5_ripple_and_god_node">
## Phase 1.5: GRAPHIFY IMPACT ANALYSIS (cross-module ripple + god node coupling)

**Purpose**: retroactive safety net for changes that affect callers outside the phase's changed-files list. Complement to /vg:build's proactive caller graph.

**Prereq**: `_shared/config-loader.md` already resolved `$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE`, `$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH`, `$PYTHON_BIN`, `$REPO_ROOT`, `$VG_TMP` at command start.

```bash
if [ "$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE" != "true" ]; then
  echo "ℹ Graphify not available — skipping Phase 1.5"
  echo "RIPPLE_SKIPPED=true" > "${PHASE_DIR}/uat-ripples.txt"
  echo "RIPPLE_SKIP_REASON=graphify-inactive" >> "${PHASE_DIR}/uat-ripples.txt"
  (type -t mark_step >/dev/null 2>&1 && mark_step "${PHASE_NUMBER:-unknown}" "phase1_5_ripple_and_god_node" "${PHASE_DIR}") || touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/phase1_5_ripple_and_god_node.done"
  "${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" .claude/scripts/vg-orchestrator mark-step review phase1_5_ripple_and_god_node 2>/dev/null || true
  # skip to Phase 2
fi
```

**⛔ BUG #3 fix (2026-04-18): Stale graphify check + auto-rebuild before ripple analysis.**

Without this, ripple analysis runs against stale graph → reports "0 callers affected"
because graph doesn't know about new callers added since last build. Falsely safe verdict.

```bash
if [ "$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE" = "true" ]; then
  GRAPH_BUILD_EPOCH=$(stat -c %Y "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" 2>/dev/null || stat -f %m "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" 2>/dev/null)
  COMMITS_SINCE=$(git log --since="@${GRAPH_BUILD_EPOCH}" --oneline 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  STALE_THRESHOLD="${GRAPHIFY_STALE_WARN:-50}"

  echo "Review Phase 1.5: graphify ${COMMITS_SINCE} commits since last build"

  # Always rebuild before ripple — review is the SAFETY NET, must be accurate
  if [ "${COMMITS_SINCE:-0}" -gt 0 ]; then
    source "${REPO_ROOT}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/graphify-safe.sh"
    vg_graphify_rebuild_safe "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" "review-phase1_5-${PHASE_NUMBER}" || {
      echo "⛔ Review cannot trust ripple analysis with stale graph"
      echo "   Fix manually: ${PYTHON_BIN} -m graphify update ."
    }
  fi
fi
```

If graphify active, proceed:

### A. Collect phase's changed files (in bash)

```bash
# Prefer phase commit range if available (git tag from /vg:build step 8b: "vg-build-{phase}-wave-{N}-start")
PHASE_START_TAG=$(git tag --list "vg-build-${PHASE_NUMBER}-wave-*-start" | sort -t'-' -k5,5n | head -1)
if [ -n "$PHASE_START_TAG" ]; then
  CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only "$PHASE_START_TAG" HEAD | sort -u)
else
  # Fallback: diff against merge-base with main
  CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD main) HEAD | sort -u)
fi

# Filter to source files only (exclude ${PLANNING_DIR}/, .claude/, node_modules, etc)
CHANGED_SRC=$(echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -vE '^\.(planning|claude|codex)/|/node_modules/|/dist/|/build/|/target/|^graphify-out/' || true)

echo "Phase changed $(echo "$CHANGED_SRC" | wc -l) source files"
echo "$CHANGED_SRC" > "${PHASE_DIR}/.ripple-input.txt"
```

### B. Ripple analysis (bash — hybrid script, no MCP)

**Why script not MCP**: graphify TS extractor doesn't resolve path aliases (e.g., `@/hooks/X` → `src/hooks/X`). Pure MCP queries miss alias-imported callers. The hybrid script uses graphify + git grep, catches both.

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} .claude/scripts/build-caller-graph.py \
  --changed-files-input "${PHASE_DIR}/.ripple-input.txt" \
  --config .claude/vg.config.md \
  --graphify-graph "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" \
  --output "${PHASE_DIR}/.ripple.json"
```

Output (`.ripple.json`):
```json
{
  "mode": "ripple",
  "tools_used": ["grep(rg|git)", "graphify"],
  "changed_files_count": N,
  "ripples": [
    {
      "changed_file": "<path>",
      "exports_at_risk": ["SymbolA", "SymbolB"],
      "callers": [
        {"file": "<caller>", "line": N, "symbol": "SymbolA", "source": ["grep(...)"]}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "affected_callers": ["<unique caller paths>"]
}
```

Script extracts exports via stack-agnostic regex (TS/JS/Rust/Python/Go), then searches scope_apps for each symbol using grep + graphify enrichment. Every caller NOT in the changed list = at-risk.

### C. God node coupling check (bash — Python API, no MCP)

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<'PY' > "${PHASE_DIR}/.god-nodes.json"
import json
from graphify.analyze import god_nodes
from graphify.build import build_from_json
from networkx.readwrite import json_graph
from pathlib import Path
data = json.loads(Path("${GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH}").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
G = json_graph.node_link_graph(data, edges="links")
gods = god_nodes(G)[:20]  # top-20 highest-degree nodes
print(json.dumps([{"label": g.get("label"), "source_file": g.get("source_file"), "degree": g.get("degree")} for g in gods], indent=2))
PY
```

Then for each god node, check if `git diff $PHASE_START_TAG HEAD` includes lines adding an import pointing to god_node's source_file — flag as coupling warning (language-aware via config.scan_patterns).

### D. Classify caller severity (orchestrator memory, post-script)

Script returns `callers` list per changed file. Orchestrator classifies:
- **HIGH**: caller's `symbol` match is a function/class/schema name (likely direct usage)
- **LOW**: caller matches only via barrel import (symbol is the filename itself, or in a re-export block)

Default LOW for ambiguous — reverse of earlier design. Rationale: too many HIGH = noise → users ignore. Start LOW, escalate via evidence.

### D. Write RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md

Write `${PHASE_DIR}/RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md`:

```markdown
# Phase {N} — Ripple Analysis (Graphify)

**Generated**: {ISO timestamp}
**Changed files in phase**: {N}
**Graph**: `graphify-out/graph.json` ({node_count} nodes)

## High-Severity Ripples (REVIEW REQUIRED)

Callers of changed code that were NOT updated in this phase. Verify these callers still work with the new symbol shapes.

| Caller File | Calls Changed Symbol | Changed In | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| {caller.file} | {symbol} | {changed.file} | HIGH |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Low-Severity Ripples (likely safe — scan for regressions)

| Caller File | Import Type | Changed In |
|---|---|---|
| {caller.file} | barrel re-export | {changed.file} |

## God Node Coupling Warnings

| God Node | Degree | New Edge From | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| {god.label} | {N} | {changed.file} | Refactor consideration |

## Summary

- HIGH ripples: {N}  (review these callers manually or via browser)
- LOW ripples: {N}
- God node warnings: {N}
- Action: Phase 2 browser discovery will prioritize checking HIGH-ripple caller paths first
```

### E. Inject findings into Phase 2 + Phase 4

**Phase 2 priority hint**: if ripple affects a specific view, browser discovery should navigate there first (higher priority in scan queue). Save `.ripple-browser-priorities.json`:

```json
{ "priority_urls": ["route1", "route2"], "reason": "high-ripple callers live here" }
```

**Phase 4 goal comparison input**: include RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md as evidence. If a goal says "Feature X works" and Feature X uses a HIGH-ripple caller that wasn't verified → flag as UNVERIFIED instead of READY.

### Fallback (graphify disabled, empty graph, or MCP errors)

Skip Phase 1.5 with warning:
```
ℹ Phase 1.5 skipped — graphify not active. Cross-module ripple bugs may
  only be caught at Phase 2 browser discovery or Phase 5 test. To enable:
  set graphify.enabled=true in .claude/vg.config.md + graphify update .
```

Still write empty `RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md` stub so Phase 4 doesn't error on missing file:
```
# Phase {N} — Ripple Analysis (SKIPPED)

## Phase 2: BROWSER DISCOVERY (MCP Playwright — organic)

**🎬 Live narration protocol (tightened 2026-04-17 — user theo dõi flow):**

Orchestrator PHẢI in dòng tiếng người BEFORE mỗi sub-phase + BEFORE mỗi view/goal đang xử lý. Khác test.md: review chạy parallel nhiều Haiku, narration ở orchestrator level không cần per-step.

**Rule:** narrator gọi ở các điểm sau trong phase 2:
- Trước 2a deploy → `narrate_phase "Phase 2a — Deploy" "Triển khai + health"`
- Trước 2b-1 navigator → `narrate_phase "Phase 2b-1 — Navigator" "Login, đọc sidebar..."`
- Sau navigator → in `Phát hiện N views: ...`
- Trước 2b-2 spawn → `narrate_phase "Phase 2b-2 — Parallel scanners"` + `Spawning N Haiku agents...`
- Khi mỗi Haiku scan xong (poll scan-*.json) → `narrate_view_scan` + `narrate_view_done`
- Trước goal sequence recording → `narrate_phase "Phase 2b-3 — Goal flows" "Ghi chuỗi thao tác..."`
- Mỗi goal → `narrate_goal_flow` + step loop + `narrate_goal_flow_end`
- Trước Phase 3 fix → `narrate_phase "Phase 3 — Fix loop" "Iteration {i}/3..."`

**If --skip-discovery, skip to Phase 4.**
**If --evaluate-only, skip to Phase 2b-3 (collect + merge scan results) → Phase 3 → Phase 4.**
  Validate: ${PHASE_DIR}/nav-discovery.json AND at least 1 scan-*.json must exist.
  Missing → BLOCK: "Run discovery first: `$vg-review {phase} --discovery-only` in Codex/Gemini."

**If --retry-failed:**
  Validate: ${PHASE_DIR}/GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md AND ${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json exist.
  Missing → BLOCK: "Run `/vg:review {phase}` first to generate initial artifacts."

  Parse GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md → collect all goals where status ≠ READY (BLOCKED, UNREACHABLE, FAILED, PARTIAL).
  If none found → print "All goals already READY. Nothing to retry." → skip to Phase 4.

  Parse RUNTIME-MAP.json → for each failed goal_id:
    start_view = goal_sequences[goal_id].start_view
  RETRY_VIEWS[] = unique(all start_views), with roles from RUNTIME-MAP views[start_view].role

  Print: "Retry mode: {N} failed goals → {M} views to re-scan: {RETRY_VIEWS[]}"

  Skip Phase 1 (code scan). Skip 2b-0 (seed). Skip 2b-1 (navigator — reuse existing nav-discovery.json).
  Go directly to 2b-2 using RETRY_VIEWS[] as view_assignments (NOT view-assignments.json).

### 2a: Deploy + Environment Prep

Deploy to target environment:
```
1. Record SHAs (local + target)
2. Build + restart on target
3. Health check → if fail → PRE-FLIGHT BLOCK (see below)
4. (v1.14.0+) Infra auto-start — nếu review.try_infra_start=true AND config có infra_start declared → chạy
5. DB seed (if configured): run_on_target "${config.environments[ENV].seed_command}"
   (skip if seed_command not in config — portable)
6. Auth bootstrap (if configured):
   For each role in config.credentials[ENV]:
     Run config.environments[ENV].auth_command with role credentials
     Save response token for API checks below
   (skip if auth_command not in config — MCP login handles auth instead)
```

Read `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/env-commands.md` — deploy(env) + preflight(env).

### 2a-infra: Tự động khởi động hạ tầng (v1.14.0+)

**Triết lý:** Review hiện skip `INFRA_PENDING` goals (ClickHouse/Kafka/Pixel không chạy). Cổng 100% không cho phép skip — review phải tự khởi động hạ tầng để goals verify được.

```bash
# Gate 1: config knob enabled?
TRY_INFRA_START=$(yq '.review.try_infra_start // true' .claude/vg.config.md 2>/dev/null)
if [ "$TRY_INFRA_START" != "true" ]; then
  echo "ℹ review.try_infra_start=false — bỏ qua bước khởi động hạ tầng"
else
  # Gate 2: env có declare infra_start không?
  INFRA_START=$(yq ".environments.${ENV}.infra_start // \"\"" .claude/vg.config.md 2>/dev/null)
  INFRA_STOP=$(yq  ".environments.${ENV}.infra_stop  // \"\"" .claude/vg.config.md 2>/dev/null)
  INFRA_STATUS=$(yq ".environments.${ENV}.infra_status // \"\"" .claude/vg.config.md 2>/dev/null)

  if [ -z "$INFRA_START" ]; then
    echo "ℹ Env '${ENV}' không declare infra_start — bỏ qua (infra không do review quản lý)"
  else
    # Gate 3: hạ tầng đã chạy sẵn chưa? (idempotent check)
    ALREADY_RUNNING=false
    if [ -n "$INFRA_STATUS" ]; then
      if eval "$INFRA_STATUS" 2>/dev/null | grep -qiE "running|up|ok|online"; then
        ALREADY_RUNNING=true
        echo "✓ Hạ tầng đã chạy sẵn (infra_status detect)"
      fi
    fi

    if [ "$ALREADY_RUNNING" = "false" ]; then
      # Gate 4: khởi động hạ tầng + trap EXIT để dọn
      narrate_phase "Phase 2a-infra — Khởi động hạ tầng" "Chạy infra_start + trap cleanup"
      echo "  Command: $INFRA_START"

      # Chạy, capture exit code
      eval "$INFRA_START"
      INFRA_START_RC=$?

      if [ $INFRA_START_RC -ne 0 ]; then
        # Hard block — không skip theo cổng 100%
        echo "⛔ infra_start THẤT BẠI (exit $INFRA_START_RC) — review không tiếp tục."
        echo "   Nguyên nhân khả dĩ: port conflict, resource thiếu, config sai."
        echo "   Debug: chạy '${INFRA_START}' thủ công xem stderr."
        echo "   Override: /vg:review ${PHASE_NUMBER} --legacy-mode (DEPRECATED, expire 2 milestones)"
        exit 1
      fi

      echo "  ✓ infra_start OK — trap infra_stop đã cài"

      # Trap: auto dọn khi review thoát (normal/error/interrupt)
      if [ -n "$INFRA_STOP" ]; then
        trap "echo '  ♻ Dọn hạ tầng (infra_stop)...'; eval \"$INFRA_STOP\" 2>/dev/null || true" EXIT INT TERM
      fi

      # Chờ hạ tầng ready (retry health 30s)
      for i in {1..30}; do
        if eval "$INFRA_STATUS" 2>/dev/null | grep -qiE "running|up|ok|online"; then
          echo "  ✓ Hạ tầng ready sau ${i}s"
          break
        fi
        sleep 1
      done

      # Emit telemetry
      if type -t telemetry_emit >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        telemetry_emit "review_infra_start_success" "{\"env\":\"${ENV}\",\"duration_s\":${i}}"
      fi
    fi
  fi
fi
```

**Tại sao không có AskUserQuestion:**  
Đây là autonomous action — config đã khai `try_infra_start: true` nghĩa là user OK. Nếu user không muốn auto-start → set `false` trong config. Giữa đêm chạy review mà lại hỏi user = anti-pattern.

**Cleanup guarantee:**  
Trap `EXIT INT TERM` bắt mọi đường thoát (normal / error / Ctrl+C). Hạ tầng sẽ stop khi review kết thúc dù success hay fail. Ngoại lệ: SIGKILL (process killed) → trap không chạy → user phải thủ công `infra_stop`.

**Cổng cứng:**  
infra_start fail → BLOCK. Không có "try again later" hay "skip INFRA_PENDING". Đây là điểm khác biệt cốt lõi với v1.13 — không cho phép defer hạ tầng.

### 2a-preflight: INFRASTRUCTURE READINESS GATE

**Review fix loop can only fix CODE bugs. Infra failures (missing config, app down, domain unreachable) must be fixed BEFORE review can work.**

Before entering Phase 2 browser discovery, verify:

```
PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST:
[ ] Build succeeded (exit 0, no TS/Rust compile errors)
[ ] Restart succeeded (pm2/systemd/dev_command exited 0, service running)
[ ] Health endpoint(s) return 200 — all entries in config.services[ENV]
[ ] All role domains from config.credentials[ENV] resolve + return any response (not ERR_CONNECTION)
[ ] At least 1 role can login successfully (curl auth endpoint, or MCP smoke login)
```

**If ANY pre-flight fails → BLOCK review with DIAGNOSTIC + FIX GUIDANCE:**

```
⛔ PRE-FLIGHT FAILED — review cannot proceed.

The review step fixes code bugs, not infrastructure. Fix the infra issue below, then re-run.

Issues detected:
  [1] {category}: {specific error}
      Example: "Build: ecosystem.config.js missing at apps/api/"
      Example: "Health: api.{domain}/health returned 502"
      Example: "Domain: advertiser.{domain} ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"
      Example: "Login: admin@{domain} POST /auth/login returned 500"

┌─ What to fix (by category) ─────────────────────────────────┐

│                      env var, DB down, port conflict.       │
│                                                             │
│ Domain unreachable → Hostname not resolving or not served.  │
│                      Local: check /etc/hosts + dev proxy.   │
│                      Sandbox: check DNS + HAProxy/nginx.    │
│                                                             │
│ Login failure      → Auth broken server-side (not code bug  │
│                      review can catch later). Check DB      │
│                      seed ran, user exists, JWT secret set. │

  **Semantic fallback (if resolver unavailable — raw AskUserQuestion):**
  - If A → set config.infra_deps.unmet_behavior="skip", continue
  - If B → switch ENV=sandbox, re-run deploy + preflight
  - If C → continue local with skip, save INFRA_PENDING goals list for sandbox retry

  Verify smoke test before any re-run:
    curl {config.services[ENV][0].health}                      # must return 200
    curl -I https://{config.credentials[ENV][0].domain}        # NOT ERR_CONNECTION
```

**Only when ALL pre-flight checks pass** → proceed to Phase 2b Browser Discovery.

API integration check — curl each endpoint in API-CONTRACTS.md:
```
For each endpoint parsed from API-CONTRACTS.md:
  If endpoint requires auth → include auth token header
  curl endpoint on target → record status code + response shape
```

### 2b: Discovery — 2-Tier Deep Scan (Opus + Haiku)

**Architecture: Opus discovers views (minimal browser), Haiku agents scan exhaustively (1 per view).**
- **Opus**: list views (1 sidebar snapshot + read SPECS), spawn Haiku, merge results, evaluate
- **Haiku**: fixed workflow scanner — click ALL elements, fill ALL forms, recurse into ALL modals. Context tiny → no lazy behavior.

**Why Haiku, not Sonnet**: AI laziness correlates with context length. Haiku agents receive a short prompt + 1 URL = near-zero context = maximum depth. Each Haiku scans 1 view exhaustively rather than skimming many views.

**MCP Server Selection:** Each Haiku agent auto-claims its own Playwright server via lock manager.
Up to 5 parallel browser sessions (5 Playwright slots configured).

#### 2b-0: Seed Data (if configured)

```
Read vg.config.md → check if seed_command exists for current ENV
IF seed_command exists:
  Run: {RUN_PREFIX} "{seed_command}"
  Wait for completion → log output
  Purpose: ensure diverse data (multiple statuses, types) so Haiku can sample representative rows
IF seed_command missing: skip silently (not a blocker)
```

#### 2b-1: Discover Views (Haiku navigator — Opus does NOT touch browser)

```
Opus reads files only (no browser):
1. Read SPECS.md → extract "In Scope" → grep route patterns
   Read PLAN.md → extract task descriptions → grep URL patterns
   Read SUMMARY.md → extract "files changed" → map to routes
   → expected_views = ["/sites", "/sites/:id", "/ad-units", ...]

2. **⛔ REGISTERED ROUTES scan (tightened 2026-04-17 — fix critical miss):**

   Sidebar DOM chỉ show top-level nav. Sub-routes đăng ký trong router config
   (ví dụ React Router `<Route path="...">`, Next.js app/pages dir, Vue Router,
   Flutter GoRouter) thường KHÔNG hiện trong sidebar → scanner miss → mark UNREACHABLE.

   **Trước khi spawn navigator, đọc route registrations từ code — pure config-driven, no defaults:**

   ```bash
   REGISTERED_ROUTES=""

   # Source 1 (preferred): graphify query — chỉ chạy khi có cả graph + predicate
   ROUTE_PRED="${config.graphify.route_predicate:-}"
   if [ "$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE" = "true" ] && [ -n "$ROUTE_PRED" ]; then
     REGISTERED_ROUTES=$(ROUTE_PRED="$ROUTE_PRED" \
                        ROUTE_EXTRACT="${config.graphify.route_path_extract:-}" \
                        ${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
import json, os, re, sys
pred = os.environ.get('ROUTE_PRED', '')
extract = os.environ.get('ROUTE_EXTRACT', '')
if not pred or not extract:
    sys.exit(0)  # config incomplete → skip
graph_path = os.environ.get('GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH')
if not graph_path or not os.path.exists(graph_path):
    sys.exit(0)
graph = json.load(open(graph_path, encoding='utf-8'))
hits = set()
for n in graph.get('nodes', []):
    blob = ' '.join(str(n.get(k,'')) for k in ('label','type','file'))
    if not re.search(pred, blob): continue
    m = re.search(extract, blob)
    if m:
        hits.add(m.group(1) if m.groups() else m.group(0))
for h in sorted(hits): print(h)
" 2>/dev/null)
   fi

   # Source 2 (fallback): grep files theo config — chỉ chạy khi có cả glob + regex
   ROUTE_GLOB="${config.code_patterns.frontend_routes:-}"
   ROUTE_REGEX="${config.code_patterns.route_path_regex:-}"
   if [ -z "$REGISTERED_ROUTES" ] && [ -n "$ROUTE_GLOB" ] && [ -n "$ROUTE_REGEX" ]; then
     REGISTERED_ROUTES=$(grep -rhoE "$ROUTE_REGEX" $ROUTE_GLOB 2>/dev/null | sort -u)
   fi

   # Report state
   if [ -n "$REGISTERED_ROUTES" ]; then
     COUNT=$(echo "$REGISTERED_ROUTES" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
     echo "✓ Found ${COUNT} route registrations từ code (source: $([ "$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE" = true ] && [ -n "$ROUTE_PRED" ] && echo graphify || echo grep))"
   elif [ -z "$ROUTE_PRED" ] && [ -z "$ROUTE_GLOB" ]; then
     echo "⚠ Route discovery KHÔNG được cấu hình (neither config.graphify.route_predicate"
     echo "  nor config.code_patterns.frontend_routes + route_path_regex set)."
     echo "  Review sẽ CHỈ dựa sidebar DOM → CÓ THỂ miss routes không trên menu."
     echo "  Add vào vg.config.md (pick 1 source, ví dụ theo stack của bạn — workflow không đoán hộ):"
     echo ""
     echo "  # Via grep (universal, cần regex ngôn ngữ):"
     echo "  code_patterns:"
     echo "    frontend_routes: '<glob tới route config files>'"
     echo "    route_path_regex: '<regex extract path với capture group>'"
     echo ""
     echo "  # HOẶC via graphify knowledge graph:"
     echo "  graphify:"
     echo "    route_predicate: '<regex match node.label/type/file>'"
     echo "    route_path_extract: '<regex extract path with capture group>'"
   else
     echo "⚠ Route config partial (need BOTH pattern+extract hoặc predicate+extract) → skip code scan."
   fi
   ```

   **Config keys (pure config-driven, workflow KHÔNG có stack defaults):**
   - `code_patterns.frontend_routes` — glob tới file chứa route declarations
   - `code_patterns.route_path_regex` — regex với capture group trả về route path
   - `graphify.route_predicate` — regex matching graphify node (label/type/file) identify route
   - `graphify.route_path_extract` — regex với capture group extract path từ matched node

   **Nguyên tắc:** Thiếu cả 2 source → warn + sidebar-only. Project quyết định stack, workflow chỉ là engine.
   (Examples per stack để tham khảo user-side; KHÔNG fallback trong code workflow.)

3. Load KNOWN-ISSUES.json (if exists):
   Filter: issues where suggested_phase == current phase OR status == "open"

4. Create GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md (all ⬜ UNTESTED)

5. Spawn 1 Haiku navigator agent (Agent tool, model="haiku"):
   prompt = """
   You are a navigator agent. Login and extract all navigation URLs.

   ## CONNECTION
   SESSION_ID="haiku-nav-{phase}-$$"
   MCP_PREFIX=$(bash "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" claim "$SESSION_ID")
   trap "bash '${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh' release \"$SESSION_ID\" 2>/dev/null" EXIT INT TERM
   Use returned $MCP_PREFIX as server for all browser tool calls.

   ## TASK
   1. Login: {domain}/login | {email} | {password}  (use first role from config)
   2. browser_snapshot → read sidebar/nav menu (top-level visible links)
   3. Extract ALL visible navigation URLs
   4. **⛔ HARD RULE (tightened 2026-04-17): REGISTERED_ROUTES list được inject vào prompt.**
      Agent PHẢI visit EVERY route trong REGISTERED_ROUTES list, KHÔNG CHỈ sidebar.
      Route không có trong sidebar = "hidden_but_registered" → truy cập qua direct URL.
      Nếu visit route bị redirect (ví dụ → /login, → /403), ghi lại reason.
   5. For each URL with :id params:
      Navigate to list page → snapshot → pick first row → extract real URL
   6. Write ${PHASE_DIR}/nav-discovery.json với schema mở rộng:
      {
        "sidebar_views": ["/sites", "/campaigns"],
        "registered_routes_visited": ["/sites", "/audit-log", "/settings/roles", ...],
        "hidden_but_registered": ["/audit-log", "/settings/roles"],
        "redirected": {"/settings/billing": "/403"},
        "actual_views": ["/sites", "/campaigns", "/audit-log", "/settings/roles", ...]
      }
   7. browser_close
   8. bash "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" release "haiku-nav-{phase}-$$"

   ## INJECTED DATA
   REGISTERED_ROUTES = [{from step 2 above — list from code scan}]
   SIDEBAR_ONLY_HINT = false  # default: visit all registered routes
   """

6. Wait for Haiku navigator → Read nav-discovery.json
   actual_views = parsed JSON .actual_views[]  (already union of sidebar + registered)

7. Merge: union(expected_views, actual_views), deduplicated, within phase scope
   Flag `hidden_but_registered` routes explicitly trong view-assignments.json
   (Haiku scanner phase 2b-2 thấy flag này → biết access qua direct URL, không click sidebar)

8. **IMMEDIATELY write view-assignments.json** — do NOT hold in context:
   Write ${PHASE_DIR}/view-assignments.json:
   {
     "phase": "{phase}",
     "generated_at": "{ISO timestamp}",
     "views": [
       { "url": "/sites", "roles": ["admin", "publisher"], "param_example": null, "source": "sidebar" },
       { "url": "/sites/123", "roles": ["publisher"], "param_example": "123", "source": "sidebar" },
       { "url": "/audit-log", "roles": ["admin"], "param_example": null, "source": "registered_hidden", "access_via": "direct_url" },
       { "url": "/settings/roles", "roles": ["admin"], "param_example": null, "source": "registered_hidden", "access_via": "direct_url" }
     ]
   }
   Trường `source` giúp Haiku scanner biết cách navigate:
   - `sidebar` → click từ menu
   - `registered_hidden` → `browser_navigate` direct URL (không có menu entry)
   
   After writing: DISCARD view list from context. Read from file when needed.

Output: view-assignments.json written to disk. Context cleared.
```

<FLUSH_RULE>
After step 8 writes view-assignments.json, you MUST NOT keep the view list in your response text.
Do NOT summarize the views found. Do NOT repeat the list.
Simply write: "view-assignments.json written — {N} views × {M} roles = {K} scan jobs."
Then immediately proceed to 2b-2 (spawn Haiku).
</FLUSH_RULE>

#### 2b-2: Spawn Haiku Scanners (parallel OR sequential per view — v1.9.4 R3.3)

<DEEPSCAN_OPT_IN_GATE_v2.42.4>
**v2.42.4+ refactor — Phase 2b-2 default OFF.**

Per the 3-tier review/test/roam refactor (see `.vg/research/ROAM-RFC-v1.md`
and `PLAN-vgflow-2026-05-01.md` Part D), exhaustive UI exploration moves
to `/vg:roam`. /vg:review keeps light browser smoke (Phase 2b-1 navigator
+ Phase 2b-3 goal recording) for goal-binding verification, but skips
the per-view Haiku exhaustive scan unless explicitly opted in.

**Skip 2b-2 entirely UNLESS one of these holds:**
- `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--with-deepscan`, OR
- `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--full-scan` (legacy alias, kept for backward compat), OR
- Phase profile is mobile-* (mobile uses sequential haiku as primary scan path), OR
- `CONFIG_REVIEW_DEEPSCAN_DEFAULT` is set to `on` in vg.config.md (per-project opt-back-in)

Skip narration:
```
echo "▸ Phase 2b-2 (Haiku per-view exhaustive scan) skipped — v2.42.4 default off."
echo "  Lens-driven exhaustive exploration now lives in /vg:roam (post-test janitor)."
echo "  Pass --with-deepscan to opt back in for this run, or set"
echo "  config.review.deepscan_default=on in vg.config.md for project-wide opt-in."
```

After echoing skip narration, jump directly to phase2b-3 (goal sequence
recording). The MANDATORY_GATE block below applies ONLY when 2b-2 is
gated ON via the conditions above.
</DEEPSCAN_OPT_IN_GATE_v2.42.4>

<MANDATORY_GATE>
**Applies only when 2b-2 is gated ON (--with-deepscan, --full-scan, mobile-*, or config opt-in).**

**You MUST spawn Haiku agents in step 2b-2** (unless spawn_mode=none for cli-tool/library profiles). This is NOT optional.
- Do NOT skip this step because "phase is small" or "I already covered everything in 2b-1"
- Do NOT replace spawning with "I'll click through views myself"
- MINIMUM: spawn at least 1 Haiku agent per view discovered in 2b-1
- The Agent tool with model="haiku" MUST be called. If it's not called, 2b-2 is incomplete.
</MANDATORY_GATE>

<SPAWN_MODE_RESOLUTION>
**v1.9.4 R3.3 — Scanner spawn mode (mobile sequential constraint):**

Mobile apps (iOS simulator, Android emulator, physical device) can typically run only ONE instance at a time. Spawning 5 parallel Haiku agents on a single emulator causes conflicts / crashes / app state corruption. CLI/library projects have no UI to scan at all.

```bash
# Resolve scanner spawn mode BEFORE entering spawn loop
resolve_scanner_spawn_mode() {
  local mode="${CONFIG_REVIEW_SCANNER_SPAWN_MODE:-auto}"
  if [ "$mode" != "auto" ]; then
    echo "$mode"
    return
  fi
  # Auto-derive from config.profile
  case "${CONFIG_PROFILE:-web-fullstack}" in
    mobile-rn|mobile-flutter|mobile-native-ios|mobile-native-android|mobile-hybrid)
      echo "sequential"  # Single emulator/simulator/device
      ;;
    cli-tool|library)
      echo "none"        # No UI to scan
      ;;
    web-fullstack|web-frontend-only|web-backend-only|*)
      echo "parallel"    # Default — multiple browser contexts supported
      ;;
  esac
}

SPAWN_MODE=$(resolve_scanner_spawn_mode)
echo ""
echo "▸ Scanner spawn mode: ${SPAWN_MODE} (profile: ${CONFIG_PROFILE:-web-fullstack})"
case "$SPAWN_MODE" in
  sequential)
    echo "📱 Sequential mode — 1 Haiku agent at a time (mobile/single-window constraint)"
    echo "   Tổng ${TOTAL} view sẽ scan tuần tự; thời gian ~${TOTAL}×5min (1 agent/view)"
    ;;
  parallel)
    echo "🌐 Parallel mode — up to 5 Haiku agents concurrent (Playwright lock caps)"
    echo "   Tổng ${TOTAL} view; thời gian ~${TOTAL}/5 × 5min"
    ;;
  none)
    echo "⏭  Spawn mode=none — skipping Phase 2b-2 entirely (profile has no UI scan)"
    echo "   Backend goals resolved via surface probes in Phase 4a instead."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "⚠ Unknown spawn_mode=${SPAWN_MODE} — falling back to parallel" >&2
    SPAWN_MODE="parallel"
    ;;
esac
```

**Behavior branch by mode:**

- **`parallel`** (web default): All Agent(model="haiku", ...) calls in ONE tool_use block → Claude Code harness runs them concurrently. Playwright lock manager caps effective concurrency at 5 slots.

- **`sequential`** (mobile default): Each Agent(model="haiku", ...) call in SEPARATE messages, awaiting completion before spawning next. Guarantees single emulator/device state. User sees 1/N → 2/N → ... progression serially.

- **`none`** (cli-tool/library): Skip 2b-2 entirely. Jump to 2b-3 collect phase (will merge 0 scans). Phase 4 goal coverage relies 100% on surface probes (api/data/integration/time-driven) from Phase 4a.

**Override via config:** Set `review.scanner_spawn_mode: "sequential"` in vg.config.md to force sequential even for web projects (e.g., if CI has constrained browser resources).
</SPAWN_MODE_RESOLUTION>

<REREAD_REQUIRED>
**Before spawning Haiku agents, you MUST re-read `view-assignments.json` via the Read tool
(fixes I5).** The `<FLUSH_RULE>` in step 2b-1 required discarding the view list from context
to save tokens. That means right now you don't have it — do NOT guess view URLs or roles
from memory. Call Read on `${PHASE_DIR}/view-assignments.json` FIRST, then iterate the
parsed `.views[]` to spawn one Haiku per (view × role) pair.

If `--retry-failed` mode, read `view-assignments-retry.json` instead. Both files share
the same schema; iteration logic is identical.
</REREAD_REQUIRED>

**Spawn 1 Haiku agent per view** using Agent tool with `model="haiku"`.
Each agent scans 1 view exhaustively with a FIXED workflow — no discretion to skip.

**Bootstrap rules injection (v1.15.0+):** Before spawning each Haiku scanner,
render + inject promoted project rules so scanners see project-specific checks
(e.g. "verify data persists after mutation" rule L-050 will fire here):
```bash
source "${REPO_ROOT:-.}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/bootstrap-inject.sh"
BOOTSTRAP_RULES_BLOCK=$(vg_bootstrap_render_block "${BOOTSTRAP_PAYLOAD_FILE:-}" "review")
vg_bootstrap_emit_fired "${BOOTSTRAP_PAYLOAD_FILE:-}" "review" "${PHASE_NUMBER}"
```
Then in each Haiku prompt body, include:
```
<bootstrap_rules>
${BOOTSTRAP_RULES_BLOCK}
</bootstrap_rules>
```
Position: after static `<scanner_workflow>` block, before `<view_assignment>`.
Scanner skill treats rules as additional per-element checks on top of fixed protocol.

IF --retry-failed:
  Normalize RETRY_VIEWS[] → view-assignments-retry.json (same schema as view-assignments.json):
    {
      "phase": "{phase}",
      "generated_at": "{ISO}",
      "mode": "retry-failed",
      "views": [{"url": "/sites", "roles": ["publisher"], "param_example": null}, ...]
    }
  READ view-assignments-retry.json
ELSE:
  READ ${PHASE_DIR}/view-assignments.json
  (both paths → same schema → downstream code identical)

view_assignments = parsed .views[]

**🎬 Pre-spawn briefing (tightened 2026-04-17 — user biết agent sẽ làm gì):**

Trước mỗi spawn, orchestrator phải:
1. Load goals map từ TEST-GOALS.md → tìm goals có `start_view == view.url` HOẶC flow references view
2. Print briefing block với: view, role, goals_covered, expected_interactions, expected_mutations
3. Set `description` của Agent tool theo format structured, không freeform

```bash

# Parse goal blocks: "## Goal G-XX: title\n...**Start view:** /path\n**Success criteria:** ...\n**Mutation evidence:** ..."
blocks = re.split(r'^##\s*Goal\s+', tg, flags=re.M)
hits = []

    m = re.match(r'(G-\d+)[:\s]+(.+?)\n', blk)
    if not m: continue
    gid, title = m.group(1), m.group(2).strip()
    # Match by start_view OR mention in flow
    start = re.search(r'\*\*Start view:\*\*\s*(\S+)', blk)
    touches = (start and start.group(1) == view_url) or (view_url in blk)
    if not touches: continue
    crit = re.search(r'\*\*Success criteria:\*\*\s*(.+?)(?:\n\*\*|\n##|\Z)', blk, re.S)

    })
for h in hits:
    print(f"{h['gid']}|{h['priority']}|{h['title']}|{h['criteria']}|{h['mutation']}")
PY
  )

  echo ""

Then spawn with **structured description** (thay vì freeform).

**⚠ SPAWN_MODE enforcement (v1.9.4 R3.3) — orchestrator branching:**

| SPAWN_MODE  | Tool-use pattern                                           | Use case                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `none`      | Skip spawn loop entirely, write empty scan-manifest, jump to 2b-3 | cli-tool, library (no UI to scan)      |
| `sequential`| Each Agent() call in **SEPARATE** message, await each complete before next | mobile-* (single emulator/device)      |
| `parallel`  | All Agent() calls in **ONE** tool_use block, harness runs concurrent ≤5 | web-* (default, multi-browser contexts)|

**When SPAWN_MODE=none:** orchestrator writes empty scan-manifest.json then skips to 2b-3:
```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
import json; from pathlib import Path
Path('${PHASE_DIR}/scans').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
Path('${PHASE_DIR}/scan-manifest.json').write_text(json.dumps({
  'mode': 'skipped_no_ui',
  'profile': '${CONFIG_PROFILE}',
  'scans': []
}, indent=2))"
# → proceed to 2b-3 collect (which handles empty scans gracefully)
```

**When SPAWN_MODE=sequential (mobile):** iterate view_assignments ONE AT A TIME. Each Agent() call in a separate message — DO NOT batch them into one tool_use block. Narrate `[idx/total] spawning <view>@<role>...` before each, `[idx/total] done (<N goals, <M regressions>)` after. User sees serial progression.

**When SPAWN_MODE=parallel (web):** batch ALL Agent() calls in ONE tool_use block so Claude harness dispatches them concurrently (Playwright lock manager caps at 5 slots).

**Common spawn pattern (applies to both sequential and parallel):**

```
For each view in view_assignments:
  For each role that can access this view (from config.credentials):
    IDX=$((IDX + 1))
    briefing_for_view "{view.url}" "{role}" "$IDX" "$TOTAL"

    # ─── Phase 15 D-17 telemetry (BEFORE spawn, not after) ──────────────

#### 2b-2.5: Recursive Lens Probe (v2.40, manager dispatcher)

**Purpose:** After parallel Haiku scanners (2b-2) complete, run the recursive lens probe layer to deep-dive each interesting clickable through bug-class lenses (authz-negative, csrf, idor, ssrf, ...). Manager dispatcher reads scan-*.json, classifies clickables into element classes, picks lenses per class, spawns workers in parallel (auto), generates prompt files (manual), or both (hybrid). Goals discovered by lens probes are merged single-writer into TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md.

**Eligibility (6 rules — all must pass unless `--skip-recursive-probe` is set):**
1. `.phase-profile` declares `phase_profile ∈ {feature, feature-legacy, hotfix}`
2. `.phase-profile` declares `surface ∈ {ui, ui-mobile}` (NOT visual-only)
3. `CRUD-SURFACES.md` declares ≥1 resource
4. `SUMMARY.md` / `RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md` lists ≥1 `touched_resources` intersecting CRUD
5. `surface != 'visual'`
6. `ENV-CONTRACT.md` present, `disposable_seed_data: true`, all `third_party_stubs` stubbed

If eligibility fails → write `.recursive-probe-skipped.yaml` and continue to 2b-3 (no error).

<MANDATORY_GATE>
**You MUST run the AskUserQuestion pre-flight below BEFORE invoking the bash block** — unless `--non-interactive` / `VG_NON_INTERACTIVE=1` is set, OR all three axes (`--recursion`, `--probe-mode`, `--target-env`) were already passed on the `/vg:review` command line.
- Do NOT skip the pre-flight because "defaults look fine" — the operator must explicitly choose recursion depth, probe execution mode, and target environment per run.
- Do NOT delegate the prompt to `spawn_recursive_probe.py` stdin — Claude Code's bash sandbox makes `sys.stdin.isatty()` return False, so script-side prompts silently fall back to defaults.
- The bash block at the end of this section will refuse to launch (loud abort + telemetry) if it detects an interactive run with no env vars set, which means the pre-flight was skipped.
- After AskUserQuestion answers, emit telemetry event `review.recursive_probe.preflight_asked` (logs the chosen axes for audit).
</MANDATORY_GATE>

**Pre-flight (v2.41.1) — operator config via AskUserQuestion:**

> ⚠ Why this lives in the command layer (not script stdin):
> Claude Code wraps bash in a sandbox where `sys.stdin.isatty()` returns `False`,
> so the script-side `input()` prompts in `spawn_recursive_probe.py` silently fall
> back to defaults (`light` / `auto` / `sandbox`) without the operator ever
> seeing them. To deliver an actual interactive UX under Claude Code, the
> command layer asks **before** invoking bash, then exports the answers as
> env vars that bash forwards via flags.

Phase 2b-2.5 has three operator-controlled axes. The orchestrator MUST resolve
all three before invoking bash:

| Env var | Source priority | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `RECURSION_MODE` | (1) `--recursion` CLI flag → (2) AskUserQuestion → (3) `light` | `light` |
| `PROBE_MODE`     | (1) `--probe-mode` CLI flag → (2) AskUserQuestion → (3) `auto` | `auto` |
| `TARGET_ENV`     | (1) `--target-env` CLI flag → (2) `vg.config review.target_env` → (3) AskUserQuestion → (4) `sandbox` | `sandbox` |

**Resolution procedure (the orchestrator runs these BEFORE the bash block):**

1. **Parse `/vg:review` CLI args.** For each of `--recursion`, `--probe-mode`,
   `--target-env` that the operator passed, set the matching env var
   (`RECURSION_MODE` / `PROBE_MODE` / `TARGET_ENV`) and skip its prompt.

2. **Skip prompts entirely if `VG_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`** (CI / piped runs) —
   downstream defaults apply.

3. **For each axis still unset, call `AskUserQuestion`** with the spec below.
   Ask in this order, ONE call per axis (so operator answers can short-circuit
   the next prompt — e.g. picking `skip` for probe-mode means we skip the
   target-env question because no probes will fire).

   **Question 1 — `RECURSION_MODE` (depth/coverage envelope):**
   - `light` *(recommended)* — ~15 workers, depth 2, goal cap 50. Quick coverage on touched resources only.
   - `deep` — ~40 workers, depth 3, goal cap 150. Typical dogfood pass.
   - `exhaustive` — ~100 workers, depth 4, goal cap 400. Pre-release sweep; expect ≥30min wall-clock.

   **Question 2 — `PROBE_MODE` (execution strategy):**
   - `auto` *(recommended)* — VG spawns Gemini Flash subprocess workers end-to-end.
   - `manual` — VG generates per-tool prompt files (`recursive-prompts/{codex,gemini}/`) for paste; operator runs CLI session, drops artifacts in `runs/<tool>/`, VG verifies. Pick when subprocess sandboxing isn't available.
   - `hybrid` — auto for high-confidence lenses (authz-negative, idor, csrf, ...), manual for human-judgment ones (business-logic, ssrf, auth-jwt). Routing comes from `vg.config review.recursive_probe.hybrid_routing`.
   - `skip` — emit `.recursive-probe-skipped.yaml` and continue to 2b-3. Logs OVERRIDE-DEBT critical with reason `"interactive: operator chose skip"`. Use when the recursive layer would be redundant (e.g. follow-up review of a phase that already passed 2b-2.5).

   **Question 3 — `TARGET_ENV` (deploy environment policy):** *only ask if probe-mode ≠ skip.*
   - `local` — full mutations OK, unlimited budget. Pick for local dev runs.
   - `sandbox` *(recommended)* — full mutations OK, 50-mutation/phase budget, disposable seed data assumed.
   - `staging` — mutations OK, `lens-input-injection` blocked, 25-mutation budget, shared-env hygiene.
   - `prod` — **READ-ONLY** (no POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE), only safe lenses fire. Requires the operator to also pass `--i-know-this-is-prod=<reason>` on the next invocation (hard gate, logs OVERRIDE-DEBT critical).

4. **Export the resolved values** so the bash block sees them:

   ```bash
   export RECURSION_MODE PROBE_MODE TARGET_ENV
   ```

5. **If the operator chose `skip` for probe-mode**, also set
   `SKIP_RECURSIVE_PROBE="interactive: operator chose skip"` before bash.

**Bash invocation:**

```bash
# v2.41.1 — env vars resolved by the AskUserQuestion pre-flight above.
# Bash forwards each axis ONLY if set; the script's argparse defaults apply
# otherwise (matches CI / VG_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 contract).

# v2.41.2 — anti-forge guard: if the orchestrator skipped the AskUserQuestion
# pre-flight (no env vars set + not in CI), refuse to launch with bare defaults.
# This catches the regression where Phase 2b-2.5 silently ran with light/auto/
# sandbox because the markdown narrative pre-flight was lazy-skipped by the LLM.

**Argparse forwarding (entry point of /vg:review):**

```bash
# /vg:review accepts these flags. The orchestrator parses them BEFORE the
# AskUserQuestion pre-flight runs and exports the matching env var so the
# operator only gets prompted for axes they didn't pre-supply:
#   --recursion={light,deep,exhaustive}     → export RECURSION_MODE=$value
#   --probe-mode={auto,manual,hybrid}       → export PROBE_MODE=$value
#   --target-env={local,sandbox,staging,prod} → export TARGET_ENV=$value
#   --skip-recursive-probe="<reason>"       → export SKIP_RECURSIVE_PROBE=$value
#   --non-interactive                       → export VG_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 (suppress AskUserQuestion + stdin prompts)
#   --i-know-this-is-prod="<reason>"        → forwarded as-is (prod-safety opt-in)
```

**Manual mode (`PROBE_MODE=manual`):**

The dispatcher writes prompt files to `${PHASE_DIR}/recursive-prompts/MANIFEST.md` and pauses. Operator runs each prompt against their preferred CLI agent (gemini/codex/claude), drops artifacts back into `${PHASE_DIR}/runs/<tool>/`, then resumes the pipeline. The verifier runs automatically when the user signals completion:

```bash
if [[ "$PROBE_MODE" == "manual" ]]; then
  echo "Manual prompts written. Follow ${PHASE_DIR}/recursive-prompts/MANIFEST.md, drop artifacts in runs/, then press Enter."
  if [[ "${VG_NON_INTERACTIVE:-0}" != "1" ]]; then
    read -r _
  fi
  python scripts/verify_manual_run_artifacts.py --phase-dir "$PHASE_DIR" || exit 1
fi
```

**Hybrid mode:** dispatcher routes per-lens to auto vs manual based on `vg.config.md → review.recursive_probe.hybrid_routing`. See [vg:_shared:config-loader] for resolution.

**Aggregation (single-writer, end of 2b-2.5):**

```bash
python scripts/aggregate_recursive_goals.py --phase-dir "$PHASE_DIR" --mode "$RECURSION_MODE"
# Writes TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md (G-RECURSE-* level-3 entries) + recursive-goals-overflow.json.
```

**Idempotency:** Re-running 2b-2.5 reuses existing `runs/` artifacts; canonical-key dedup in aggregator prevents duplicate goal stubs.

**Failure semantics:** Eligibility fail → skip block (continue). Worker fail → recorded in `runs/INDEX.json`, does not abort pipeline. Manual mode timeout → operator re-runs; no automatic retry.

#### 2b-3: Collect, Cross-Check, Fill Gaps (Opus, no browser)

```
1. Wait for all Haiku agents to complete

2. Read SUMMARIES ONLY (not full JSON):
   For each scan-{view}-{role}.json:
     Read only the top-level fields: view, role, elements_total, elements_visited,
     elements_stuck, errors[] count, forms[] count, sub_views_discovered[]
   → Build slim overview: { view, visited_pct, error_count, stuck_count }
   
   IF a view has error_count > 0 OR stuck_count > 3 OR visited_pct < 90%:
     THEN read that view's full scan-{view}-{role}.json for detail
   ELSE: discard full JSON content — do NOT load into context

3. Cross-check coverage vs SPECS:
   - SPECS says phase has payments feature → Haiku found /payments? ✓
   - PLAN says 3 modals built → Haiku found 3 modals? ✓
   - Haiku discovered sub-views not in original list? → note for gap-filling
   
4. Gaps detected:
   - View listed but Haiku couldn't reach → Opus investigates (wrong URL? auth?)
   - Haiku found sub-views (e.g., /sites/123/settings) → spawn more Haiku
   - Elements marked "stuck" (file upload, complex wizard) → Opus handles or defers
   
5. Spawn additional Haiku agents if gaps found → collect → merge

6. MERGE all scan results into coverage-map:
   views = all Haiku view results
   errors = concatenate + deduplicate
   stuck = concatenate
   forms = concatenate
   
7. QUALITY CHECK (Opus judgment on Haiku results):
   Flag suspicious results:
     - elements_visited < elements_total without stuck explanation → mark INCOMPLETE
     - Form submitted but no network request recorded → mark SUSPICIOUS
     - Console errors present but Haiku didn't report them → mark NEEDS_REVIEW
     - elements_total very low for a complex page → mark SHALLOW (Haiku may have missed scroll/lazy-load)

8. UPDATE GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX:
   For each TEST-GOALS goal, check if Haiku scan results cover it:
   - Form submitted matching goal's mutation → ⬜ → 🔍 SCAN-COVERED
   - View explored but goal-specific action not triggered → ⬜ → ⚠️ SCAN-PARTIAL
   - View not scanned → ⬜ → ❌ NOT-COVERED
   
   Note: Haiku scanners don't pursue goals — they scan exhaustively.
   Goal coverage mapping is done by Opus reading scan results.

9. PROBE VARIATIONS (OPT-IN — only runs if --with-probes flag set):
   Default OFF: /vg:test generates deterministic Playwright probes via codegen — cheaper,
     more reliable than LLM-driven probes, and already covers edit/boundary/repeat patterns.
   Only set --with-probes when: test codegen can't cover the mutation (e.g., complex data
     setup, external service stubs), or debugging a goal that passed scan but failed probes.

   IF NOT --with-probes: skip to step 10.

   For each goal marked SCAN-COVERED that involves mutations (create/edit/delete):
   
   Spawn Haiku probe agent (model="haiku"):
   """
   You are a probe agent. Test mutation variations for goal: {goal_id}.
   
   URL: {view_url} | Login: {credentials}
   Primary action: {what Haiku scan already did — from scan JSON}
   
   Run 3 probes:
   
   Probe 1 — EDIT: Navigate to the record just created/modified.
     Open edit form → change 1-2 fields (different valid data) → submit
     → Record: {changed_fields, result, network[], console_errors[]}
   
   Probe 2 — BOUNDARY: Open same form again.
     Fill with edge values: empty optional fields, max-length "A"×255,
     special chars "O'Brien <script>", zero for numbers, past dates
     → Submit → Record: {values_description, result, validation_errors[]}
   
   Probe 3 — REPEAT: Open same form again.
     Fill with EXACT same data as primary scan → submit
     → Expect: success OR proper duplicate error — NOT crash/500
     → Record: {result, is_duplicate_handled}
   
   Write to: {PHASE_DIR}/probe-{goal_id}.json
   """
   
   Collect all probe JSONs → merge into goal_sequences[goal_id].probes[]
   Update matrix: SCAN-COVERED + probes passed → 🔍 PROBE-VERIFIED

10. For NOT-COVERED or SHALLOW items:
   Opus does targeted investigation using its own MCP Playwright:
   - Claim 1 server
   - Navigate to specific view/element
   - Investigate why Haiku missed it
   - Release server

<CHECKPOINT_RULE>
**Atomic artifact per major step — no separate state file (v1.14.4+):**
- Step 2b-1 → writes `${PHASE_DIR}/nav-discovery.json` (atomic)
- Step 2b-2 → writes `${PHASE_DIR}/scan-{view-slug}.json` per Haiku agent (atomic per view)
- Step 2b-3 → writes `${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json` + `${PHASE_DIR}/GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`
- Steps 8/9/10 → extend RUNTIME-MAP.json + GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md

If session dies mid-2b-2: re-run `/vg:review {phase}` — nav-discovery.json + partial scan-*.json stay, orchestrator redoes only missing views. Per-view scan is cheap (~30s Haiku call), no need for global state file. Step-level idempotency handled by `.step-markers/*.done`.
</CHECKPOINT_RULE>
```

**Session model (from config):**
- `$SESSION_MODEL` = "multi-context": each Haiku agent uses own browser context (natural fit)
- "single-context": agents run sequentially sharing 1 context (fallback)
- Roles come from `config.credentials[ENV]` — NOT hardcoded

### 2d: Build RUNTIME-MAP

**3-layer schema: navigation graph + interactive elements + goal action sequences.**

No component-type classification (no "modal", "table", "card" types). Elements are binary: interactive or not. State changes are observed via fingerprint diff (URL + element count + DOM hash), not classified.

**Schema design principles (from research):**
- **No component types** — elements are just `{ selector, label, visited }`. AI doesn't classify "button" vs "link" vs "row action". Binary: interactive or not. (browser-use approach)
- **State change = fingerprint diff** — URL changed? element_count changed? dom_hash changed? = "something changed". AI describes *what* changed in free text `observe` steps. (browser-use PageFingerprint approach)
- **Goal sequences = replayable action chains** — each step is `do` (action) or `observe` (observation) or `assert` (verification). Test step replays these 1:1. Codegen converts to .spec.ts nearly 1:1. (Playwright codegen approach)
- **Free exploration = flat list** — unstructured, just records what AI found outside goal scope. Issues go to Phase 3.
- **All values from runtime observation** — selectors from browser_snapshot, labels from visible text, observations from what AI actually sees. Nothing invented.

Derive `${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.md` from JSON (human-readable summary):

**Phase 15 D-17 — phantom-aware Haiku spawn audit (NEW, 2026-04-27):**

Confirm the `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` event emitted by step 2b-2 is
actually present in events.db for every (view × role) we expected to scan.
The validator (`verify-haiku-spawn-fired.py`) is phantom-aware: it ignores
events from runs whose signature matches `args:""` + 0 step.marked + abort
within 60s (the D-17 hook-triggered noise pattern), so manual `/vg:learn`
invocations don't show up as false positives.

## Phase 2c — Enrich TEST-GOALS from runtime discovery (v2.34.0+, closes #52)

Bridges the design gap between **Step 3 (click many components)** and **Step 4 (rich goals for test layer)** of the original 4-step review architecture. Without this step, every Haiku-discovered button/form/modal/tab/row-action sits dead in `views[X].elements[]` and the downstream test layer never tests it.

`enrich-test-goals.py` reads every `scan-*.json`, classifies elements (modal triggers, mutations, forms, table row actions, paging, tabs), dedupes against existing TEST-GOALS.md `interactive_controls`, and emits `${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS-DISCOVERED.md` with `G-AUTO-*` goal stubs. `/vg:test` codegen (step 5d) reads both files; auto-emitted specs land as `auto-{goal-id}.spec.ts` for visual distinction.

## Phase 2c-pre — Contract completeness + env preflight (v2.39.0+)

Two pre-dispatch gates close Codex critiques #1 (contract validity not gated) + #6 (env state implicit):

1. `verify-contract-completeness.py` diffs runtime/code inventory against CRUD-SURFACES.md declared resources. Flags hidden routes, undeclared resources, background jobs, webhooks.
2. `verify-env-contract.py` reads ENV-CONTRACT.md preflight_checks and verifies each (app reachable, seed data present, login works).

If contract incomplete OR env preflight fails → review aborts BEFORE spawning expensive workers (Gemini Flash workers can run $0.30-1.00 per phase; aborting pre-spawn saves token cost when env is broken).

  # Output gets: { artifacts: { screenshot, hierarchy } }
  # Pass both to Haiku scanner (see step phase2_haiku_scan_mobile below)
done
```

**Haiku scanner — mobile variant:**

The scanner skill (`vg-haiku-scanner`) accepts either browser snapshot
(web path) or Maestro screenshot+hierarchy (mobile path). When mobile
artifacts are present, skill reads `hierarchy.json` (Maestro's view
hierarchy export) as element tree instead of DOM snapshot. See
`vgflow/skills/vg-haiku-scanner/SKILL.md` section "Mobile input mode".

Per goal, spawn a Haiku agent with prompt:

```
Context:
  Goal: {G-XX title + success criteria from TEST-GOALS.md}
  Platform: {ios|android}
  Screenshot: {PHASE_DIR}/discover/{G-XX}-{PLATFORM}.png
  Hierarchy: {PHASE_DIR}/discover/{G-XX}-{PLATFORM}.hierarchy.json
  Mode: mobile

Output: scan-{G-XX}-{PLATFORM}.json with findings per same schema as web
  (view_found, elements_count, issues[], goal_status).
```

**Bounded parallelism:**

Same as web — cap at 5 concurrent Haiku agents to avoid rate-limit.
Device concurrency is 1 per physical/simulator instance (maestro holds
exclusive connection), so platforms run sequentially per device but
multiple devices (iOS sim + Android emu) can run parallel.

**Artifact contract (MUST match web schema):**

Every mobile scan writes `scan-{G-XX}-{PLATFORM}.json` identical in
shape to web `scan-{G-XX}.json`. Downstream steps (`phase3_fix_loop`,
`phase4_goal_comparison`, `/vg:test` codegen) do not branch on profile
at artifact-read level — they read scan-*.json agnostic of source.

This keeps Phase 3/4 code zero-touch in the mobile rollout.

<step name="phase2_5_visual_checks" profile="web-fullstack,web-frontend-only">
## Phase 2.5: VISUAL INTEGRITY CHECK

**Config gate:** Read `visual_checks` from vg.config.md. If `visual_checks.enabled` != true → skip.

**Prereq:** Phase 2 must have produced RUNTIME-MAP.json with at least 1 view. Missing → skip.

**MCP Server:** Reuse same `$PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER` from Phase 2. Do NOT claim new lock.

```bash
VISUAL_ISSUES=()
VISUAL_SCREENSHOTS_DIR="${PHASE_DIR}/visual-checks"
mkdir -p "$VISUAL_SCREENSHOTS_DIR"
```

For each view in RUNTIME-MAP.json:

### 1. FONT CHECK (if visual_checks.font_check = true)

```
browser_evaluate:
  JavaScript: |
    await document.fonts.ready;
    const failed = [...document.fonts].filter(f => f.status !== 'loaded');
    return failed.map(f => ({ family: f.family, weight: f.weight, style: f.style, status: f.status }));
```

- Empty → PASS. Non-empty with status "error" → MAJOR. Status "unloaded" → MINOR.

### 2. OVERFLOW CHECK (if visual_checks.overflow_check = true)

```
browser_evaluate:
  JavaScript: |
    const overflowed = [];
    document.querySelectorAll('*').forEach(el => {
      const style = getComputedStyle(el);
      if (['scroll','auto'].includes(style.overflowY) || ['scroll','auto'].includes(style.overflowX)) return;
      if (style.display === 'none' || style.visibility === 'hidden') return;
      const vO = el.scrollHeight > el.clientHeight + 2 && style.overflowY === 'hidden';
      const hO = el.scrollWidth > el.clientWidth + 2 && style.overflowX === 'hidden';
      if (vO || hO) {
        const rect = el.getBoundingClientRect();
        if (rect.width === 0 || rect.height === 0) return;
        overflowed.push({
          selector: el.tagName.toLowerCase() + (el.id ? '#'+el.id : '') +
            (el.className && typeof el.className === 'string' ? '.'+el.className.trim().split(/\s+/).join('.') : ''),
          type: vO ? 'vertical' : 'horizontal',
          rect: { top: rect.top, left: rect.left, width: rect.width, height: rect.height }
        });
      }
    });
    return overflowed;
```

- Main content (rect.left > config sidebar_width) → MAJOR. Sidebar/nav → MINOR.

### 3. RESPONSIVE CHECK (per viewport in visual_checks.responsive_viewports, default [1920, 375])

```
browser_resize: { width: viewport_width, height: 900 }
browser_evaluate: "await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500)); return null;"
browser_take_screenshot: { path: "${VISUAL_SCREENSHOTS_DIR}/${view_slug}-${viewport_width}w.png" }
browser_evaluate:
  JavaScript: |
    return {
      hasHorizontalScroll: document.body.scrollWidth > window.innerWidth,
      clippedElements: [...document.querySelectorAll('*')]
        .filter(el => { const r = el.getBoundingClientRect(); return r.right > window.innerWidth + 5 && r.width > 0 && r.height > 0; })
        .slice(0, 10)
        .map(el => ({ selector: el.tagName + (el.id ? '#'+el.id : ''), overflow: Math.round(el.getBoundingClientRect().right - window.innerWidth) }))
    };
```

- Desktop (>=1024) horizontal scroll → MAJOR. Mobile (<1024) → MINOR.

After all viewports: `browser_resize: { width: 1920, height: 900 }`

### 4. Z-INDEX CHECK (only views with modals in RUNTIME-MAP)

For each modal: trigger open → check topmost via `document.elementFromPoint` at center + corners → screenshot → close.
- Modal not topmost OR <75% corners visible → MAJOR.

### 5. Write visual-issues.json

```json
[{"view":"...","check_type":"font_load_failure","severity":"MAJOR","element":"Inter","viewport":null}]
```

Issues feed into Phase 3 fix loop: MAJOR = priority fix, MINOR = logged.

```
Phase 2.5 Visual Integrity:
  Views: {N}, Font: {pass}/{total}, Overflow: {pass}/{total}
  Responsive: {viewports} x {views} ({issues} issues)
  Z-index: {modals} modals ({issues} issues)
  MAJOR: {N} → Phase 3 fix loop | MINOR: {N} → logged
```

### 6. Phase 15 D-12 — Wave-scoped + Holistic Drift Gates (NEW, 2026-04-27)

After the legacy visual checks (font/overflow/responsive/z-index), run the
Phase 15 visual-fidelity gates. Threshold comes from `.fidelity-profile.lock`
written by `/vg:blueprint` step 2_fidelity_profile_lock (D-08).

**6e. L4 — Design-fidelity SSIM gate (NEW, 2026-04-28):**

Final safety net for the 4-layer pixel pipeline. L1 (executor reads PNG) +
L2 (LAYOUT-FINGERPRINT) + L3 (build-time render vs baseline) all run
during /vg:build. This gate runs during /vg:review using the live browser
session — if any of the upstream layers were skipped or overridden, this
catches the drift before it leaves the phase. **Severity = BLOCK** by
design; override `--allow-design-drift` consumes a rationalization-guard
slot and logs override-debt.

## Phase 2.5 (mobile): VISUAL INTEGRITY CHECK

**Config gate:**
Read `visual_checks.enabled` from vg.config.md. If not true → skip with message
and jump to Phase 3.

**Prereq:** phase2_mobile_discovery produced screenshots in `${PHASE_DIR}/discover/`.
Missing → skip + warn: "No mobile discovery artifacts — visual checks require device snapshot first."

**Why this step differs from web:** mobile devices have fixed viewports per
model (an iPhone 15 Pro IS its viewport). There's no browser resize loop.
Instead we capture multi-device if user listed multiple emulators/simulators
in `config.mobile.devices.<plat>[]`, or re-check the already-captured
screenshots against per-platform sanity rules.

```bash
VISUAL_ISSUES=()
VIS_DIR="${PHASE_DIR}/visual-checks"
mkdir -p "$VIS_DIR"
WRAPPER="${REPO_ROOT}/.claude/scripts/maestro-mcp.py"
```

### Check 1: Font / text rendering (per captured screenshot)

Parse each `${PHASE_DIR}/discover/*.hierarchy.json`. For every text node
with non-empty `text`, verify corresponding element has `frame.height > 0`
(i.e. rendered, not invisible font). Missing → MINOR (font not loaded or
style override hiding text).

```bash
for HIER in "${PHASE_DIR}"/discover/*.hierarchy.json; do
  [ -f "$HIER" ] || continue
  MISSING=$(${PYTHON_BIN} - "$HIER" <<'PY'
import json, sys
from pathlib import Path
h = json.loads(Path(sys.argv[1]).read_text(encoding='utf-8'))
def walk(node, out):
    if isinstance(node, dict):
        text = (node.get('text') or node.get('attributes', {}).get('text') or '').strip()
        frame = node.get('frame') or node.get('bounds') or {}
        hgt = frame.get('height') if isinstance(frame, dict) else None
        if text and isinstance(hgt, (int, float)) and hgt <= 0:
            out.append({'text': text[:40], 'height': hgt})
        for c in (node.get('children') or []):
            walk(c, out)
    elif isinstance(node, list):
        for c in node:
            walk(c, out)
out = []
walk(h, out)
print(json.dumps(out))
PY
  )
  echo "$MISSING" > "$VIS_DIR/font-missing-$(basename "$HIER" .hierarchy.json).json"
done
```

Severity: any text-with-zero-height = MINOR (log in VISUAL_ISSUES).

### Check 2: Off-screen content (mobile equivalent of overflow check)

Parse frame coordinates. For each element with `frame.y + frame.height > device_height`
or `frame.x + frame.width > device_width`, flag as MAJOR if it's in main
content area, MINOR if near navigation bar.

Device dimensions come from screenshot metadata (PIL image size) — no
hardcoded per-device map needed.

### Check 3: Multi-device sanity (if config lists multiple emulator/simulator names)

If `config.mobile.devices.android.emulator_name` lists N values (as array
rather than single string), capture a screenshot on each and compare:
- Do text labels fit without truncation (`...` or ellipsis heuristic)?
- Do tap targets have ≥44pt minimum size (iOS HIG) or ≥48dp (Material)?

Single-device setups skip this check.

### Check 4: Z-index / modal occlusion

If any hierarchy shows a node with `role=Modal` or `accessibilityTrait=modal`,
verify its frame covers the center of the screen AND no sibling has higher
z-order. Maestro hierarchy exposes sibling order via array index; elements
later in array are on top.

### Reporting

```bash
cat > "${PHASE_DIR}/visual-issues.json" <<EOF
{
  "platform_coverage": $(ls "${PHASE_DIR}"/discover/*.hierarchy.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l),
  "issues": [ /* MINOR/MAJOR items collected */ ],
  "summary": {"major": N, "minor": N}
}
EOF
```

MAJOR → handled in Phase 3 fix loop. MINOR → logged only.

## Phase 2.7: URL state sync declaration check (Phase J)

→ `narrate_phase "Phase 2.7 — URL state sync" "Kiểm tra interactive_controls trong TEST-GOALS"`

**Purpose:** validate every list/table/grid view goal in TEST-GOALS.md
declares `interactive_controls` block (filter/sort/pagination/search +
URL sync assertion). This is the static-side complement to runtime
browser probing — declaration must exist before runtime can verify.

**CRUD surface precheck (v2.12):** before URL-state checks, validate
`${PHASE_DIR}/CRUD-SURFACES.md`. Review compares runtime observations against
the resource/platform contract first, then uses `interactive_controls` as the
web-list extension pack. Missing CRUD contract means the reviewer has no
authoritative list of expected headings, filters, columns, states, row actions,
delete confirmations, or security/abuse expectations.

```bash
CRUD_FLAGS=""
[[ "${ARGUMENTS:-}" =~ --allow-no-crud-surface ]] && CRUD_FLAGS="--allow-missing"
CRUD_VAL="${REPO_ROOT}/.claude/scripts/validators/verify-crud-surface-contract.py"

    echo "   Fix blueprint artifact CRUD-SURFACES.md or rerun /vg:blueprint."
    exit 2
  fi
fi
```

**Why:** modern dashboard UX baseline (executor R7) requires list view
state synced to URL search params. Without declaration, AI executors
build local-state-only filters and ship apps that lose state on refresh.
This validator catches the gap at /vg:review time, before user sees it.

**Severity:** config-driven via `vg.config.md → ui_state_conventions.severity_phase_cutover`

debt entry.

```bash

**Future runtime probe (deferred to v2.9):** once RUNTIME-MAP.json is
populated by phase 2 browser discovery, a follow-up validator can click
each declared control via MCP Playwright + snapshot URL pre/post +
assert reload-survives. Static declaration check is the foundation that
makes runtime probe meaningful.

Final action: `(type -t mark_step >/dev/null 2>&1 && mark_step "${PHASE_NUMBER:-unknown}" "phase2_7_url_state_sync" "${PHASE_DIR}") || touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/phase2_7_url_state_sync.done"`

<step name="phase2_8_url_state_runtime" profile="web-fullstack,web-frontend-only">
## Phase 2.8: URL state runtime probe (v2.7 Phase A)

→ `narrate_phase "Phase 2.8 — URL state runtime probe" "Click từng control + snapshot URL để verify declaration vs implementation"`

**Purpose:** verify that the static `interactive_controls` declarations
(checked at phase 2.7) match actual application behaviour. AI drives MCP
Playwright through every declared control, captures URL params before/after
each interaction, writes the result to
`${PHASE_DIR}/url-runtime-probe.json`. Validator reads that artifact and
flags coverage gaps (WARN) or declaration drift (BLOCK).

**Why:** static declarations close ~50% of URL-state bugs; runtime probe
catches the remaining drift class — declaration says `?status=...` but
the route handler ships `?state=...`, or the filter pretends to sync but
no `pushState` actually fires.

**Skip conditions:**
- No goal in TEST-GOALS.md has `interactive_controls.url_sync: true` → skip silently.
- `${RUN_ARGS}` contains `--skip-runtime` → run validator with the same flag (logs OD debt).
- Browser environment unavailable (no MCP Playwright) → invoke validator with `--skip-runtime`.

### 2.8a Drive the probe (AI agent task)

For every goal in `${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS.md` that declares
`interactive_controls.url_sync: true`:

1. Determine the goal's route from `${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json` (key
   matching the goal id) or, when the goal frontmatter carries an explicit
   `route:` field, prefer that.
2. Authenticate as `goal.actor` (default `admin`) using the standard
   review-phase auth helper.
3. Navigate to the route. Wait for the list/table/grid to be visible.
4. For every entry in the goal's `interactive_controls`:
   - **filter** — pick the first declared `values[0]`, click the filter
     control, snapshot URL.
   - **sort** — apply the first declared column, snapshot URL.
   - **pagination** — click page 2 (or scroll once for `infinite-scroll`),
     snapshot URL.
   - **search** — type a representative query, wait `debounce_ms + 100ms`,
     snapshot URL.
5. Also compare the observed route against `${PHASE_DIR}/CRUD-SURFACES.md`
   `platforms.web.list`: heading/description presence, declared table columns,
   row actions, empty/loading/error/unauthorized states where reachable, and
   delete confirmation if a delete action is declared.
6. Append one entry per goal to `url-runtime-probe.json`.

**Artifact schema** (`${PHASE_DIR}/url-runtime-probe.json`):

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-04-26T10:30:00Z",
  "goals": [
    {
      "goal_id": "G-01",
      "url": "/admin/campaigns",
      "controls": [
        {
          "kind": "filter",
          "name": "status",
          "value": "active",
          "url_before": "https://app.local:5173/admin/campaigns",
          "url_after": "https://app.local:5173/admin/campaigns?status=active",
          "url_params_after": {"status": "active"}
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`kind` is one of `filter | sort | pagination | search`. `name` matches the
declared control name (or normalised — `page` for pagination, `search` for
search, `sort` for sort). `url_params_after` is the parsed search-param
dict.

### 2.8b Run validator

    echo "  3. Override (last resort): re-run with --allow-runtime-drift (logs soft OD debt)."
    exit 2
  fi
fi
```

Final action: `(type -t mark_step >/dev/null 2>&1 && mark_step "${PHASE_NUMBER:-unknown}" "phase2_8_url_state_runtime" "${PHASE_DIR}") || touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/phase2_8_url_state_runtime.done"`
</step>

<step name="phase3_fix_loop">
## Phase 3: FIX LOOP (max 3 iterations)

→ `narrate_phase "Phase 3 — Fix loop (iteration ${I}/3)" "Sửa bug MINOR, escalate MODERATE/MAJOR"`

**If no errors found in Phase 2 → skip to Phase 4.**
**If --fix-only → load RUNTIME-MAP, find errors, fix them.**

### 3a: Error Summary

Collect errors from ALL sources:
- RUNTIME-MAP.json: `errors[]` array + per-view `issues[]` + failed `goal_sequences` + `free_exploration` issues
- `${PHASE_DIR}/REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md` (if exists — written by /vg:test when MODERATE/MAJOR issues found):
  Parse issues table → add to error list with severity from test classification
  These are issues test couldn't fix — review MUST address them in this fix loop
- `${PLANNING_DIR}/KNOWN-ISSUES.json`: issues matching current phase/views (already loaded at init)

### 3b: Classify Errors

For each error:
- **CODE BUG** → fix immediately (wrong logic, missing validation, UI mismatch)
- **INFRA ISSUE** → escalate to user (service unavailable, config wrong)
- **SPEC GAP** → record in SPEC-GAPS.md (see 3b-spec-gaps) — feature not built, decision missing from CONTEXT/PLAN
- **PRE-EXISTING** → don't fix, write to `${PLANNING_DIR}/KNOWN-ISSUES.json` (see below)

### 3b-spec-gaps: Feed SPEC_GAPS back to blueprint (fixes G9)

When ≥3 SPEC_GAP errors accumulate, or any critical-priority goal maps to SPEC_GAP, emit `${PHASE_DIR}/SPEC-GAPS.md` and surface to user with a concrete re-plan command:

```markdown
# Spec Gaps — Phase {phase}

Detected during /vg:review phase 3b. Listed issues trace to missing CONTEXT decisions or un-tasked PLAN items — not code bugs. Review cannot fix these; blueprint must re-plan.

## Gaps
| # | Observed Issue | Related Goal | Likely Missing | Source Evidence |
|---|----------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Site delete has no confirmation modal | G-08 (delete site) | D-XX: "delete requires confirmation" decision | screenshot {phase}-sites-delete-error.png |
| 2 | Bulk import UI absent | G-12 (bulk import) | Task for CSV upload handler + FE form | grep "bulk" in code returns 0 matches |
...

## Recommended action

This is NOT a code bug. Re-run blueprint in patch mode to append tasks covering these gaps:

    /vg:blueprint {phase} --from=2a

This spawns planner with the gap list as input. Existing tasks preserved; missing ones appended. Then re-run build → review.

Do NOT attempt to fix these in the review fix loop — the fix loop targets code bugs, not missing scope.
```

Threshold + auto-suggestion:
```bash
SPEC_GAP_COUNT=$(count of SPEC_GAP-classified errors)
CRITICAL_SPEC_GAPS=$(count where related goal is priority:critical)

if [ $SPEC_GAP_COUNT -ge 3 ] || [ $CRITICAL_SPEC_GAPS -ge 1 ]; then
  echo "⚠ ${SPEC_GAP_COUNT} spec gaps detected (${CRITICAL_SPEC_GAPS} critical)."
  echo "See: ${PHASE_DIR}/SPEC-GAPS.md"
  echo ""
  echo "This is a planning gap, not a code bug. Recommended:"
  echo "   /vg:blueprint ${PHASE} --from=2a   (re-plan with gap feedback)"
  echo ""
  echo "Review fix loop will continue for code bugs only; spec gaps stay open until blueprint re-run."
fi
```

Do NOT block review — let fix loop handle code bugs. Just surface spec gaps with the right next command.

### 3b-known: Write PRE-EXISTING to KNOWN-ISSUES.json

Shared file across all phases: `${PLANNING_DIR}/KNOWN-ISSUES.json`

```
Read existing KNOWN-ISSUES.json (create if missing)

For each PRE-EXISTING error:
  Check if already recorded (match by view + description)
  IF new → append:
    {
      "id": "KI-{auto_increment}",
      "found_in_phase": "{current phase}",
      "view": "{view_path where observed}",
      "description": "{what's wrong}",
      "evidence": { "network": [...], "console_errors": [...], "screenshot": "..." },
      "affects_views": ["{list of views where this issue appears}"],
      "suggested_phase": "{phase that owns this area — AI infers from code_patterns}",
      "severity": "low|medium|high",
      "status": "open"
    }

Write back KNOWN-ISSUES.json
```

**Future phases auto-consume:** At the start of every review (Phase 2, before discovery), read KNOWN-ISSUES.json → filter issues where `suggested_phase` matches current phase OR `affects_views` overlaps with views being reviewed → display to AI as "known issues to verify/fix in this phase".

### 3c: Fix + Ripple Check + Redeploy

**🎯 3-tier fix routing (tightened 2026-04-17 — cost + context isolation):**

Sau khi bug classified ở 3a/3b (MINOR/MODERATE/MAJOR + size metadata), route tới model phù hợp theo config. Main model KHÔNG tự fix mọi thứ — MODERATE phải spawn để isolate context và save main-model tokens.

**Config (pure user-side, workflow không giả định model vendor/tier):**

```yaml
# vg.config.md
models:
  # Existing keys: planner, executor, debugger
  review_fix_inline: <model-id>    # model cho MINOR inline (thường = main/planner tier)
  review_fix_spawn:  <model-id>    # model cheaper cho MODERATE + MINOR-big-scope

review:
  fix_routing:
    minor:
      inline_when:
        max_files: <int>
        max_loc_estimate: <int>
      else: "spawn"                # route to models.review_fix_spawn
    moderate:
      action: "spawn"              # always route to models.review_fix_spawn
      parallel: <bool>
      max_concurrent: <int>
    major:
      action: "escalate"           # REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md, không auto-fix
    tripwire:
      minor_bloat_loc: <int>
      action: "warn|rollback"
```

Workflow CHỈ đọc model id từ `config.models.review_fix_inline` / `review_fix_spawn`. Không hardcode tên vendor (Claude/GPT/Gemini), tier (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, o3/gpt-4o), hay capability.

Thiếu config → fallback: inline = main model hiện tại, spawn = cùng model (degraded — không có cost optimization nhưng vẫn có context isolation).

**Algorithm per CODE BUG:**

```
1. Load severity từ error classification (step 3b)
2. Estimate fix scope trước khi fix:
   - files_to_touch = heuristic từ error location + related callers
   - loc_estimate = peek file around error line, count context
3. Route theo severity:
```

**MINOR + small scope → inline (fast path, main model):**
```
If severity == MINOR AND files <= config.review.fix_routing.minor.inline_when.max_files
                   AND loc_estimate <= config.review.fix_routing.minor.inline_when.max_loc_estimate:
  Main model reads file + edits inline (current behavior)
  narrate_fix "[inline] MINOR ${bug_title} (${files} files, ~${loc} LOC)"
```

**MINOR big scope OR MODERATE → spawn (config-driven model):**
```
SPAWN_MODEL="${config.models.review_fix_spawn:-${config.models.executor}}"

Agent(
  model="$SPAWN_MODEL",
  description="[fix ${idx}/${total}] ${severity} ${file}:${line} — ${bug_type}"
):
  prompt = """
  Fix this reviewed bug. Focused scope — no tangent changes.

  ## BUG
  Severity: ${severity}
  Observed: ${error_description}
  Expected: ${expected_behavior}
  View: ${view_url}
  File hint: ${suspected_file}
  Evidence: ${console_errors}, ${network_failures}, ${screenshot}

  ## CONSTRAINTS
  - Touch only files related to this bug
  - No refactor/rename unless required for fix
  - Write test if missing (project convention)
  - Commit: fix(${phase}): ${short description}
  - Per CONTEXT.md D-XX OR Covers goal: G-XX in commit body

  ## RETURN
  - Files changed (list)
  - LOC delta
  - One-line summary
  """

narrate_fix "[spawn:sonnet] ${severity} ${bug_title}"
```

**MAJOR → escalate (no auto-fix):**
```
Append to REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md:
| bug_id | view | severity | description | why_escalated |

narrate_fix "[escalated] MAJOR ${bug_title} → REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md"
```

**Parallel spawning:**

Nếu `config.review.fix_routing.moderate.parallel: true` và có >1 MODERATE bugs độc lập (no shared files):
- Group bugs by affected file → spawn Sonnet parallel per group
- Max `config.review.fix_routing.moderate.max_concurrent` at once
- Wait all → aggregate commits

**Post-fix tripwire (catch misclassification):**

```bash
TRIPWIRE_LOC="${config.review.fix_routing.tripwire.minor_bloat_loc:-0}"
TRIPWIRE_ACTION="${config.review.fix_routing.tripwire.action:-warn}"

if [ "$TRIPWIRE_LOC" -gt 0 ]; then
  # Check each MINOR-routed-inline fix
  for commit in $MINOR_INLINE_COMMITS; do
    ACTUAL_LOC=$(git show --stat "$commit" | tail -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+ insertion' | grep -oE '^[0-9]+')
    if [ "${ACTUAL_LOC:-0}" -gt "$TRIPWIRE_LOC" ]; then
      case "$TRIPWIRE_ACTION" in
        rollback)
          echo "⛔ MINOR inline fix bloated ($ACTUAL_LOC > $TRIPWIRE_LOC LOC) — rolling back, re-route Sonnet"
          git reset --hard "${commit}^"
          # Re-queue bug với severity upgrade → MODERATE → spawn Sonnet
          ;;
        warn|*)
          echo "⚠ MINOR fix ($commit) bloated: $ACTUAL_LOC LOC > $TRIPWIRE_LOC threshold. Consider re-classify."
          echo "tripwire: $commit actual_loc=$ACTUAL_LOC severity=MINOR" >> "${PHASE_DIR}/build-state.log"
          ;;
      esac
    fi
  done
fi
```

**Narration format:**

```
  ▶ Fix 1/5: [inline] MINOR edit button label mismatch
       ✓ Fixed 1 file, 2 LOC

  ▶ Fix 2/5: [spawn] MODERATE form validation missing on /sites/new
       ✓ Agent completed: 3 files, 24 LOC  (model: ${SPAWN_MODEL})

  ▶ Fix 3/5: [escalated] MAJOR bulk import UI absent
       → REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md

  ▶ Fix 4/5: [inline] MINOR CSS overflow on mobile
       ⚠ Tripwire hit: 45 LOC > 15 threshold — flagged for re-classify
```

Narrator chỉ hiển thị model id user đã config, KHÔNG hardcode "Sonnet"/"GPT-4o"/etc.

**Then for each fixed bug (inline OR via Sonnet):**

1. Read the relevant source file
2. Fix the issue
3. **Ripple check (graphify-powered, if active):**
   ```bash
   if [ "$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE" = "true" ]; then
     # Get files changed by this fix
     FIXED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only HEAD)
     echo "$FIXED_FILES" > "${PHASE_DIR}/.fix-ripple-input.txt"

     # Run ripple analysis on fixed files
     ${PYTHON_BIN} .claude/scripts/build-caller-graph.py \
       --changed-files-input "${PHASE_DIR}/.fix-ripple-input.txt" \
       --config .claude/vg.config.md \
       --graphify-graph "$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH" \
       --output "${PHASE_DIR}/.fix-ripple.json"

     # Check if fix affects callers outside the fixed file
     RIPPLE_COUNT=$(${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
     import json
     d = json.load(open('${PHASE_DIR}/.fix-ripple.json'))
     callers = d.get('affected_callers', [])
     print(len(callers))
     ")

     if [ "$RIPPLE_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
       echo "⚠ Fix ripple: ${RIPPLE_COUNT} callers may be affected by this change"
       echo "  Adding caller views to re-verify list (step 3d)"
       # Map caller files → views for re-verification in step 3d
       RIPPLE_VIEWS=$(${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
       import json
       d = json.load(open('${PHASE_DIR}/.fix-ripple.json'))
       for c in d.get('affected_callers', []):
         print(c)
       ")
     fi
   fi
   ```
   Without graphify: step 3d re-verifies affected views by git diff only (may miss indirect callers).
4. Commit with message: `fix({phase}): {description}`

After all fixes:
```
Redeploy using env-commands.md deploy(env)
Health check → if fail → rollback
```

### 3d: Re-verify (Sonnet parallel — focused on fixed zones)

After fix+redeploy, spawn Sonnet agents to re-verify affected views + ripple zones:

```
1. Get new SHA: git rev-parse HEAD
2. git diff old_sha..new_sha → list changed files
3. Map changed files to views (using code_patterns from config):
   - Changed API routes → views that call those endpoints
   - Changed page components → those specific views
   - Graphify ripple callers (from step 3c) → views importing those callers
4. Group affected views + ripple views into zones

5. Spawn Sonnet agents (parallel) for affected zones ONLY:
   Agent prompt: "Re-verify these fixed actions in {zone}.
     Previous errors: {error list from 3a}
     Expected: errors should be resolved.
     Test each previously-failed action.
     Also check: did the fix break anything else on this view?
     Report: {action, was_broken, now_works, new_issues}"

6. Wait all → merge results:
   - Fixed errors → update matrix: ❌ → 🔍 REVIEW-PASSED
   - Still broken → keep ❌, increment iteration
   - New errors from fix → add to error list
   - Update RUNTIME-MAP with corrected observations
   - Log current build SHA in PIPELINE-STATE.json `steps.review.last_fix_sha`
```

### 3e: Iterate

Repeat 3a-3d until:
- RUNTIME-MAP is **stable** (no new errors between 2 iterations)
- Zero CODE BUG errors remaining
- Max 3 iterations reached

Display after each iteration:
```
Fix iteration {N}/3:
  Errors fixed: {N}
  Errors remaining: {N} (infra: {N}, spec-gap: {N}, pre-existing: {N})
  Sonnet agents spawned: {N} (re-verified {M} views)
  New errors found: {N}
  Matrix coverage: {review_passed}/{total} goals
  Map stable: {YES|NO}
```
</step>

<step name="phase4_goal_comparison">
## Phase 4: GOAL COMPARISON

→ `narrate_phase "Phase 4 — Goal comparison" "So khớp ${N} goals từ TEST-GOALS với views đã khám phá"`

### 4a: Load Goals

Read `${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS.md` (generated by /vg:blueprint).
If missing → generate from CONTEXT.md + API-CONTRACTS.md (fallback).

Parse goals: ID, description, success criteria, mutation evidence, dependencies, priority.

**Surface classification (v1.9.1 R1 — lazy migration, runs BEFORE browser discover decisions):**

```bash
# shellcheck source=_shared/lib/goal-classifier.sh
. .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/goal-classifier.sh
set +e
classify_goals_if_needed "${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS.md" "${PHASE_DIR}"
gc_rc=$?
set -e
# rc=2 → Haiku tie-break (spawn Task per row in .goal-classifier-pending.tsv, then classify_goals_apply)
# rc=3 → AskUserQuestion (surface list from config), then classify_goals_apply
```

Parse `**Surface:** <name>` per goal.

**Surface-aware routing (tightened v1.9.1 R1):**

For each goal:
- `surface == "ui"` / `"ui-mobile"` → proceed with existing browser RUNTIME-MAP lookup below.
- `surface ∈ { api, data, time-driven, integration, custom }` → skip browser discover for this goal; instead run lightweight **surface probe**:
  * `api`        → grep `apps/**/src/**` for route handler matching contract path → READY if present.
  * `data`       → grep migrations + `config.infra_deps` for table/collection → READY if present; INFRA_PENDING if service unavailable.
  * `time-driven`→ grep cron/scheduler registration in `apps/workers/**`/`apps/api/**` → READY if handler wired.
  * `integration`→ check `${PHASE_DIR}/test-runners/fixtures/${gid}.integration.sh` exists AND downstream caller found → READY.

Result feeds GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX with `(status, surface, probe_evidence)`.

**Pure-backend fast-path:**
```bash
UI_GOAL_COUNT=$(grep -c '^\*\*Surface:\*\* ui' "${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS.md" || echo 0)
if [ "$UI_GOAL_COUNT" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "🧭 Pure-backend phase (không có goal UI) — bỏ qua browser discovery (khám phá trình duyệt), dùng surface probes." >&2
  # Emit empty RUNTIME-MAP if not written yet, skip to 4b
  [ -f "${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json" ] || echo '{"views":{},"goal_sequences":{}}' > "${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json"
fi
```

**Mixed-phase surface probe execution (v1.9.2.3 P3):**

For phases có CẢ UI goals (cần browser) VÀ backend goals (api/data/integration/time-driven), browser phase chỉ cover UI goals. Backend goals PHẢI được probe SEPARATELY để avoid rơi vào NOT_SCANNED branch.

```bash
# Run surface probes cho goals có surface ≠ ui
source "${REPO_ROOT}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/surface-probe.sh" 2>/dev/null || true
if type -t run_surface_probe >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  PROBE_RESULTS_JSON="${PHASE_DIR}/.surface-probe-results.json"
  echo '{"probed_at":"'"$(date -u +%FT%TZ)"'","results":{' > "$PROBE_RESULTS_JSON"
  FIRST=true

  # Extract goal_id + surface pairs from TEST-GOALS.md
  ${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
import re
tg = open('${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS.md', encoding='utf-8').read()
for gid, surface in re.findall(r'^## Goal (G-[\w]+):.*?^\*\*Surface:\*\* (\w[\w-]*)', tg, re.M|re.S):
    print(f'{gid} {surface}')
" | while read -r gid surface; do
    surface="${surface%$'\r'}"
    # Skip UI — browser phase handles them
    [ "$surface" = "ui" ] || [ "$surface" = "ui-mobile" ] && continue

    PROBE=$(run_surface_probe "$gid" "$surface" "$PHASE_DIR" 2>/dev/null)
    STATUS=$(echo "$PROBE" | cut -d'|' -f1)
    EVIDENCE=$(echo "$PROBE" | cut -d'|' -f2- | sed 's/"/\\"/g')

    [ "$FIRST" = "true" ] && FIRST=false || echo "," >> "$PROBE_RESULTS_JSON"
    printf '"%s":{"surface":"%s","status":"%s","evidence":"%s"}' \
           "$gid" "$surface" "$STATUS" "$EVIDENCE" >> "$PROBE_RESULTS_JSON"
  done

  echo '}}' >> "$PROBE_RESULTS_JSON"

  # Summary narration
  PROBED=$(${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
import json
d = json.load(open('$PROBE_RESULTS_JSON'))['results']
from collections import Counter
c = Counter(r['status'] for r in d.values())
print(f'Phase 4a surface probes: {len(d)} backend goals probed → {dict(c)}')")
  echo "▸ $PROBED"
fi
```

**Phase 4b integration:** Khi check goal_sequences cho backend goals (surface ≠ ui), trước khi mark NOT_SCANNED hãy check `.surface-probe-results.json`:
- Nếu probe READY → map → STATUS: READY với evidence từ probe (handler path, migration file, caller reference).
- Nếu probe BLOCKED → map → STATUS: BLOCKED với evidence là probe reason.
- Nếu probe INFRA_PENDING → map → STATUS: INFRA_PENDING.
- Nếu probe SKIPPED (can't parse criteria) → fallthrough to NOT_SCANNED branch → buộc user cải thiện TEST-GOALS hoặc override.

**Infra dependency filter (config-driven):**

If goal has `**Infra deps:**` field (e.g., `[clickhouse, kafka, pixel_server]`):
```bash
# Check each infra dep against current environment
for dep in goal.infra_deps:
  SERVICE_CHECK=$(read config.infra_deps.services[dep].check_${ENV})
  if ! eval "$SERVICE_CHECK" 2>/dev/null; then
    goal.status = "INFRA_PENDING"
    goal.skip_reason = "${dep} not available on ${ENV}"
  fi
done
```

Goals classified as `INFRA_PENDING` are **excluded from gate calculation** (when `config.infra_deps.unmet_behavior == "skip"`). They don't count as BLOCKED or FAIL — they're simply not testable on current environment.

Display: `INFRA_PENDING ({dep})` in matrix with distinct icon.

**Console noise filter (config-driven):**

When evaluating console errors from Phase 2 discovery, filter against `config.console_noise.patterns`:
```bash
if [ "${config_console_noise_enabled}" = "true" ]; then
  for pattern in config.console_noise.patterns:
    # Remove matching errors from bug list — classify as INFRA_NOISE
    REAL_ERRORS=$(echo "$ALL_CONSOLE_ERRORS" | grep -viE "$pattern")
  done
  NOISE_COUNT=$((TOTAL_ERRORS - REAL_ERROR_COUNT))
  echo "Console: ${REAL_ERROR_COUNT} real errors, ${NOISE_COUNT} infra noise (filtered)"
fi
```

Only REAL_ERRORS (not matching noise patterns) count as view failures.

### 4b: Map Goals to RUNTIME-MAP

For each goal, check goal_sequences in RUNTIME-MAP.json:

```
For each goal:
  IF goal_sequences[goal_id] exists AND result == "passed":
    → STATUS: READY (goal was verified during Pass 2a)

  IF goal_sequences[goal_id] exists AND result == "failed":
    → STATUS: BLOCKED (with specific failure steps from goal_sequence)

  IF goal_sequences[goal_id] does NOT exist:
    # Before marking UNREACHABLE, verify code presence to distinguish
    # true "not built" from "built but not scanned"
    code_exists = check via grep against config.code_patterns:
      - Does goal's expected page file exist? (e.g., FloorRulesListPage.tsx)
      - Is the route registered? (e.g., /floor-rules in router)
      - Do related API endpoints have handlers? (grep API-CONTRACTS vs apps/api/)

    IF code_exists == FALSE:
      → STATUS: UNREACHABLE (feature not built — fix with /vg:build --gaps-only)

    IF code_exists == TRUE:
      → STATUS: NOT_SCANNED (intermediate only — MUST resolve before review exits)
      Root cause likely one of:
        - Multi-step wizard/mutation needs dedicated browser session
        - Goal path not reachable from discovered sidebar (orphan route)
        - Review ran --retry-failed but this goal wasn't in retry set
        - Haiku agent timed out or skipped
        - Goal has no UI surface but TEST-GOALS didn't mark infra_deps
      → RESOLUTION (tightened 2026-04-17 — NOT_SCANNED không được defer sang /vg:test):
        NOT_SCANNED là trạng thái TRUNG GIAN, KHÔNG phải kết luận hợp lệ.
        Review PHẢI resolve thành 1 trong 4 status kết luận: READY | BLOCKED | UNREACHABLE | INFRA_PENDING
        Cách resolve (pick 1):
          a) /vg:review {phase} --retry-failed với deeper probe (nếu timeout/depth issue)
          b) Goal không có UI surface → update TEST-GOALS với `**Infra deps:** [<user-defined no-ui tag>]` → re-classify INFRA_PENDING (tag value do user định nghĩa trong config.infra_deps, workflow không hardcode)
          c) Orphan/hidden route → verify config.code_patterns.frontend_routes đã cover pattern đó
          d) Genuinely unreachable (feature đã build nhưng UX path không exist) → manually mark UNREACHABLE with reason note
```

**Status semantics (tightened 2026-04-17):**

4 **status kết luận hợp lệ** (chỉ 4 status này được write vào GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX final):

| Status | Meaning | Fix command |
|---|---|---|
| READY | Goal verified, evidence in goal_sequences | none |
| BLOCKED | View found, scan ran, criteria failed | fix code → `--retry-failed` |
| UNREACHABLE | Code not in repo / UX path không exist | `/vg:build --gaps-only` |
| INFRA_PENDING | Goal needs service/infra not available on ENV | deploy infra or sandbox |

2 **status trung gian** (PHẢI resolve trước khi exit Phase 4):

| Status | Meaning | Action BẮT BUỘC |
|---|---|---|
| NOT_SCANNED | Code exists, review didn't replay | `--retry-failed` HOẶC re-classify thành 1 trong 4 status trên |
| FAILED | Scan timeout/exception | check logs → `--retry-failed` |

**⛔ GLOBAL RULE: KHÔNG được defer NOT_SCANNED sang /vg:test.**

Lý do: `/vg:test` codegen LẤY steps từ `goal_sequences[]` mà review ghi. NOT_SCANNED = review không ghi sequence = codegen không có input. Test không phải fallback cho review miss.

Goals không có UI surface đúng ra phải mark `infra_deps: [<no-ui tag>]` trong TEST-GOALS (tag value do project config quy ước) → skip ở review (INFRA_PENDING) → test qua integration/unit layer ở build phase, KHÔNG qua /vg:test E2E.

### 4d: Inline triage + apply scope-tag actions (v1.14.0+ A.2)

Triage chạy **inline** ngay sau matrix ghi, TRƯỚC 100% gate. Mục đích: đọc scope tag (`depends_on_phase`, `verification_strategy`) từ CONTEXT.md, phân loại mỗi UNREACHABLE thành verdict + action_required, rồi áp dụng action nào autonomous được (mark_deferred/mark_manual). Các action cần người quyết định (spawn_fix_agent, draft_amendment_ask, prompt_scope_tag) sẽ ghi vào hàng đợi nhưng vẫn BLOCK gate — **không có đường thoát ngụỵ trang**.

### 4e: Cổng 100% (hard, v1.14.0+ A.3)

Thay gate trọng số (critical/important/nice-to-have) cũ bằng quy tắc đơn giản:

- **ĐẠT (PASS)** khi `BLOCKED == 0` VÀ `UNREACHABLE == 0` (goals ở trạng thái kết thúc: READY + DEFERRED + MANUAL + INFRA_PENDING).
- **BỊ CHẶN (BLOCK)** khi còn bất kỳ goal `BLOCKED` hoặc `UNREACHABLE`.

Không còn grey zone — DEFERRED và MANUAL là hai đường thoát hợp lệ nhưng phải declare ở `/vg:scope`, không phải review tự gắn.

## CrossAI Review (mandatory when CLIs are configured)

**If config.crossai_clis is empty, emit an explicit skip note and continue.**
**If --skip-crossai is present, it must have override-debt evidence because
objective review is otherwise a silent quality downgrade.**

Prepare context with RUNTIME-MAP + GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX + TEST-GOALS.
Set `$LABEL="review-check"`. Follow crossai-invoke.md.

Required evidence when not skipped:
- `${PHASE_DIR}/crossai/review-check.xml`
- `crossai.verdict` telemetry event
</step>

<step name="write_artifacts">
## Write Final Artifacts

**Write order: JSON first, then derive MD from it.**

**1. `${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json`** — canonical JSON (source of truth). MUST be written FIRST.
**2. `${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.md`** — derived from JSON (human-readable). Written AFTER JSON.
**3. `${PHASE_DIR}/GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`** — from Phase 4
**4. `${PHASE_DIR}/element-counts.json`** — from Phase 1b

### MANDATORY ARTIFACT VALIDATION (do NOT skip)

After writing all files, verify they exist before committing:
```
Required files — BLOCK commit if ANY missing:
  ✓ ${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json     ← downstream /vg:test reads this, NOT .md
  ✓ ${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.md
  ✓ ${PHASE_DIR}/GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md

Use Glob to confirm each file exists. If RUNTIME-MAP.json is missing,
you MUST create it before proceeding. The .md alone is NOT sufficient.
```

Commit:
```bash
git add ${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json ${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.md \
       ${PHASE_DIR}/GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md ${PHASE_DIR}/element-counts.json \
       ${SCREENSHOTS_DIR}/

<step name="bootstrap_reflection">
## End-of-Step Reflection (v1.15.0 Bootstrap Overlay)

Before closing review, spawn the **reflector** subagent to analyze this step's
artifacts + user messages + telemetry and draft learning candidates for user
review. Primary path for project self-adaptation.

**Skip conditions** (reflection does nothing, exit 0):
- `.vg/bootstrap/` directory absent (project hasn't opted in)
- `config.bootstrap.reflection_enabled == false` (user disabled)
- Review verdict = `FAIL` with fatal errors (reflect when next review succeeds)

### Run

```bash
BOOTSTRAP_DIR=".vg/bootstrap"
if [ ! -d "$BOOTSTRAP_DIR" ]; then
  # Bootstrap not opted in — skip silently
  :
else
  REFLECT_TS=$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
  REFLECT_OUT="${PHASE_DIR}/reflection-review-${REFLECT_TS}.yaml"
  USER_MSG_FILE="${VG_TMP}/reflect-user-msgs-${REFLECT_TS}.txt"

  : > "$USER_MSG_FILE"

  # Filter telemetry entries to this phase+step within last 4 hours

  echo "📝 Running end-of-step reflection (Haiku, isolated context)..."
fi
```

### Spawn reflector agent (isolated Haiku)

Use Agent tool with skill `vg-reflector`, model `haiku`, fresh context:

```
Agent(
  description="End-of-step reflection for review phase {PHASE}",
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  prompt="""
Use skill: vg-reflector

Arguments:
  STEP           = "review"
  PHASE          = "{PHASE}"
  PHASE_DIR      = "{PHASE_DIR absolute path}"
  USER_MSG_FILE  = "{USER_MSG_FILE}"
  TELEMETRY_FILE = "{TELEMETRY_SLICE}"
  OVERRIDE_FILE  = "{OVERRIDE_SLICE}"
  ACCEPTED_MD    = ".vg/bootstrap/ACCEPTED.md"
  REJECTED_MD    = ".vg/bootstrap/REJECTED.md"
  OUT_FILE       = "{REFLECT_OUT}"

Read .claude/skills/vg-reflector/SKILL.md and follow workflow exactly.
Do NOT read parent conversation transcript — echo chamber forbidden.
Output max 3 candidates with evidence to OUT_FILE.
"""
)
```

### Interactive promote flow (user gates)

After reflector exits, parse OUT_FILE. If candidates found, show to user:

```
📝 Reflection — review phase {PHASE} found {N} learning(s):

[1] {title}
    Type: {type}
    Scope: {scope}
    Evidence: {count} items — {sample}
    Confidence: {confidence}

    → Proposed: {target summary}

    [y] ghi sổ tay  [n] reject  [e] edit inline  [s] skip lần này

[2] ...

User gõ: y/n/e/s cho từng item, hoặc "all-defer" để bỏ qua toàn bộ.
```

For `y` → delegate to `/vg:learn --promote L-{id}` internally (validates schema,
dry-run preview, git commit).

For `n` → append to REJECTED.md with user reason.

For `e` → interactive field-by-field edit loop (not external editor):
```
Editing [1]:
  (1) title: "{current}"
  (2) scope: {current}
  (3) prose: "{current}"
  (4) target_step: {current}
  Field to edit? [1-4/done]: _
```

For `s` → leave candidate in `.vg/bootstrap/CANDIDATES.md`, user reviews later via `/vg:learn --review`.

### Emit telemetry

```bash
emit_telemetry "bootstrap.reflection_ran" PASS \
  "{\"step\":\"review\",\"phase\":\"${PHASE}\",\"candidates\":${CANDIDATE_COUNT:-0}}"
```

### Failure mode

Reflector crash or timeout → log warning, continue to `complete` step. Never block review completion.

```
⚠ Reflection failed — review completes normally. Check .vg/bootstrap/logs/
```

**v2.6.1 (2026-04-26): Auto-resolve hotfix debt entries from prior phases.**

If THIS phase's review ran clean (no `--allow-orthogonal-hotfix` /
`--allow-no-bugref` / `--allow-empty-bugfix` overrides hit), prior phases'
OPEN debt entries with matching gate_id auto-resolve. Closes AUDIT.md D2 H4
(hotfix overrides had no natural resolution path → debt piled up forever).

Each gate_id maps to a specific re-run condition that the current clean
review proves: if review passed without orthogonal-hotfix override, the
"goal-coverage" condition is satisfied for prior phases too.

```bash
source "${REPO_ROOT}/.claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/override-debt.sh" 2>/dev/null || true
if type -t override_auto_resolve_clean_run >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # Only resolve if THIS phase didn't fall back to the override itself
  if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --allow-orthogonal-hotfix ]]; then
    override_auto_resolve_clean_run "review-goal-coverage" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
      "review-clean-${PHASE_NUMBER}-$(date -u +%s)" 2>&1 | sed 's/^/  /'
  fi
  if [[ ! "${ARGUMENTS}" =~ --allow-no-bugref ]]; then
    override_auto_resolve_clean_run "bugfix-bugref-required" "${PHASE_NUMBER}" \
      "review-clean-${PHASE_NUMBER}-$(date -u +%s)" 2>&1 | sed 's/^/  /'

```

**Display — VERDICT-AWARE next steps (MANDATORY format).**

The closing message MUST follow this structure regardless of orchestrator (Claude / Codex / Gemini).
Every finding section MUST end with a concrete actionable command, not just a description.

### When verdict = PASS
```
Review complete for Phase {N} — PASS.
  Goals: {ready}/{total} READY ({pct}%)
  Gate: PASS (critical {C}/{C} 100%, important {I}/{I_total} ≥80%)
  Artifacts: RUNTIME-MAP.json + GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md{REVIEW_FEEDBACK_SUFFIX}

Next:
  /vg:test {phase}            # codegen + run regression suite
```

### When verdict = FLAG (passed but with improvements)
```
Review complete for Phase {N} — FLAG ({N} non-blocking findings).
  Goals: {ready}/{total} READY
  Gate: PASS-WITH-FLAGS

Findings (improvements — non-blocking):
  - [Med] {one-line summary} → fix at {file:line}, then commit
  - [Low] {one-line summary} → defer or fix at {file:line}
  ... (full detail in REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md)

Next (pick one):
  /vg:test {phase}                          # proceed — flags are advisory
  edit {file:line}; git commit; /vg:next    # fix flags first, then continue
```

### When verdict = BLOCK (cannot proceed)
```
Review complete for Phase {N} — BLOCK.
  Goals: {ready}/{total} READY ({blocked} BLOCKED, {failed} FAILED, {unreach} UNREACHABLE)
  Gate: BLOCK ({reason — e.g., "critical goal G-03 FAILED" or "infra success_criteria 1/8 READY"})

Findings (severity-grouped — full detail in REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md):
  ⛔ Critical/Nghiêm trọng ({N}):
     1. {one-line summary}
        ↳ Fix: {concrete action — file:line, command, or workflow}
        ↳ Verify: {how to confirm — curl, test, diff}
     2. ...
  ⚠ High/Cao ({N}):
     ... (same format)
  ⓘ Medium/Trung bình ({N}):
     ... (same format)

Next steps (pick the matching path — DO NOT just re-run /vg:review blindly):

  A. Fix code bugs found → re-review:
     # Edit affected files (paths above), then stage + commit as SEPARATE
     # steps (v2.5.2.7: don't chain staging with commit — if commit-msg
     # hook BLOCKs on missing citation, prior `git add` success gets
     # masked by the red "Exit 1" UI label):
     git add path/to/fixed-file.ts              # stage intentional files
     git commit -m "fix({phase}-XX): {summary}

Per CONTEXT.md D-XX OR Per API-CONTRACTS.md"  # body must cite
     /vg:review {phase} --retry-failed      # only re-scan failed goals (faster)
     # OR /vg:review {phase}                # full re-scan if many fixes

  B. If findings need scope discussion (architectural, decision change):
     /vg:amend {phase}                       # mid-phase change request workflow
     # then re-blueprint + re-build before re-review

  C. If findings are infra/env (services down, config missing):
     /vg:doctor                              # diagnose env + service health
     # fix infra → /vg:review {phase}

  D. If finding is BUG in /vg:review tooling itself (not phase code):
     /vg:bug-report                          # surface to vietdev99/vgflow

  E. If you DISAGREE with verdict (false positive):
     # Open REVIEW-FEEDBACK.md, dispute specific finding with evidence
     /vg:review {phase} --override-reason "..." --allow-failed=G-XX
     # Will register in OVERRIDE-DEBT — re-evaluated at /vg:accept
```

### Hard rules for AI orchestrator (Claude/Codex/Gemini)
1. **Never end a BLOCK review without listing per-finding fixes + verify steps.** Bare list of issues = user has to re-derive next action — anti-pattern.
2. **Use RELATIVE paths** in narration (`apps/api/src/plugins/health.ts:23`), NOT absolute (`/D/Workspace/...`). Absolute paths waste 60% of terminal width on repeated prefixes.
3. **Per-finding format MUST be:**
   ```
   {N}. [Severity] {ONE LINE root-cause}
        ↳ Fix:    {file:line edit OR shell command OR workflow}
        ↳ Verify: {1-line check command OR test ID}
        ↳ Refs:   {file:line, file:line}  (only if 2+ refs needed)
   ```
4. **Closing MUST contain "Next:" block** with at least 2 labeled options (A/B/C...) when verdict ≠ PASS.
5. **If executor cannot run something** (bash broken, no internet, missing creds), say so EXPLICITLY and tell user the manual command to run instead. Don't bury it in middle of output.
