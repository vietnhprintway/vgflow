## Codex ⇆ Claude Code tool mapping

This skill was originally designed for Claude Code. When running in Codex CLI, translate tool calls using the table + patterns below.

### Tool mapping table

| Claude tool | Codex equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | request_user_input (free-form text, or number-prefix choices) | For multi-select, format as "1. Option / 2. Option" and parse reply |
| Task (agent spawn) | `codex exec --model <model> "<prompt>"` subprocess | Foreground: `codex exec ... > /tmp/out.txt`. Parallel: launch N subprocesses + `wait`. See "Agent spawn" below |
| TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TodoWrite | N/A — use inline markdown headers + status narration | Codex does not have a persistent task tail UI. Write `## ━━━ Phase X: step ━━━` in stdout instead |
| Monitor | Bash loop with `echo` + `sleep 3` polling | Codex streams stdout directly, no separate monitor channel |
| ScheduleWakeup | N/A — Codex is one-shot; user must re-invoke | Skill must tolerate single-execution model; no sleeping |
| WebFetch | `curl -sfL <url>` or `gh api <path>` | For GitHub URLs prefer `gh` for auth handling |
| mcp__playwright{1-5}__* | See "Playwright MCP" below | Playwright MCP tools ARE available in Codex's main orchestrator |
| mcp__graphify__* | `python -c "from graphify import ..."` inline | Graphify CLI/module works identically in Codex |
| mcp__context7__*, mcp__exa__*, mcp__firecrawl__* | Skip or fall back to WebFetch | Only available via SDK; not bundled in Codex CLI |
| Bash/Read/Write/Edit/Glob/Grep | Same — Codex supports these natively | No adapter needed |

### Agent spawn (Task → codex exec)

Claude Code spawns isolated agents via `Task(subagent_type=..., prompt=...)`. Codex equivalent:

```bash
# Single agent, foreground (wait for completion + read output)
codex exec --model gpt-5 "<full isolated prompt>" > /tmp/agent-result.txt 2>&1
RESULT=$(cat /tmp/agent-result.txt)

# Multiple agents, parallel (Claude's pattern of 1 message with N Task calls)
codex exec --model gpt-5 "<prompt 1>" > /tmp/agent-1.txt 2>&1 &
PID1=$!
codex exec --model gpt-5 "<prompt 2>" > /tmp/agent-2.txt 2>&1 &
PID2=$!
wait $PID1 $PID2
R1=$(cat /tmp/agent-1.txt); R2=$(cat /tmp/agent-2.txt)
```

**Critical constraints when spawning:**
- Subagent inherits working directory + env vars, but **no MCP server access** (Codex exec spawns fresh CLI instance without `--mcp` wired). Subagent CANNOT call `mcp__playwright*__`, `mcp__graphify__`, etc.
- Model mapping for this project: `models.planner` opus → `gpt-5`, `models.executor` sonnet → `gpt-4o`, `models.scanner` haiku → `gpt-4o-mini` (or project-configured equivalent). Check `.claude/vg.config.md` `models` section for actual values and adapt.
- Timeout: wrap in `timeout 600s codex exec ...` to prevent hung subagents.
- Return schema: if skill expects structured JSON back, prompt subagent with "Return ONLY a single JSON object with keys: {...}". Parse with `jq` or `python -c "import json,sys; ..."`.

### Playwright MCP — orchestrator-only rule

Playwright MCP tools (`mcp__playwright1__browser_navigate`, `_snapshot`, `_click`, etc.) ARE available to the main Codex orchestrator (same MCP servers as Claude Code). **BUT subagents spawned via `codex exec` do NOT inherit MCP access** — they are fresh CLI instances.

Implication for skills using Haiku scanner pattern (scanner spawns → uses Playwright):
- **Claude model:** spawn haiku agent with prompt → agent calls `mcp__playwright__` tools directly
- **Codex model:** TWO options:
  1. **Orchestrator-driven:** main orchestrator calls Playwright tools + passes snapshots/results to subagent as text → subagent returns instructions/analysis only (no tool calls). Slower but preserves parallelism benefit.
  2. **Single-agent:** orchestrator runs scanner workflow inline (no spawn). Simpler but no parallelism; suitable for 1-2 view scans but slow for 14+ views.

Default: **single-agent inline** unless skill explicitly documents the orchestrator-driven pattern for that step.

### Persistence probe (Layer 4) — execution model

For review/test skills that verify mutation persistence:
- Main orchestrator holds Playwright session (claimed via lock manager)
- Pre-snapshot + submit + refresh + re-read all run in orchestrator Playwright calls (not spawned)
- If skill delegates analysis to subagent, orchestrator must capture snapshots + pass text to subagent; subagent returns verdict JSON `{persisted: bool, pre: ..., post: ...}`

### Lock manager (Playwright)

Same as Claude:
```bash
SESSION_ID="codex-${skill}-${phase}-$$"
PLAYWRIGHT_SERVER=$(bash "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" claim "$SESSION_ID")
trap "bash '${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh' release \"$SESSION_ID\" 2>/dev/null" EXIT INT TERM
```

Pool name in Codex: `codex` (separate from Claude's `claude` pool). Lock manager handles both without collision.

## Invocation

This skill is invoked by mentioning `$vg-sync`. Treat all user text after `$vg-sync` as arguments.

If argument-hint in source frontmatter is not empty and user provides no args, ask once via request_user_input before proceeding.

<objective>
Keep VG workflow files consistent across 3 locations:
1. **Source**: `.claude/commands/vg/` (edit here trong dev repo)
2. **Mirror**: `vgflow/` (distribute this to other projects)
3. **Installations**:
   - `.codex/skills/vg-*/` (current project Codex)
   - `~/.codex/skills/vg-*/` (global Codex — dùng cho mọi project)

Script delegates to `vgflow/sync.sh`. Runs bidirectional sync: edit ở source → mirror về vgflow → deploy tới installations.
</objective>

<process>

<step name="0_detect">

**v1.11.0 R5 — `vgflow/` folder deprecated. Use external `vgflow-repo` clone:**

```bash
# Resolution priority (highest first):
SYNC_SH=""
for candidate in \
  "${VGFLOW_REPO:-}/sync.sh" \
  "../vgflow-repo/sync.sh" \
  "../../vgflow-repo/sync.sh" \
  "${HOME}/Workspace/Messi/Code/vgflow-repo/sync.sh" \
  "vgflow/sync.sh"  ; do
  if [ -f "$candidate" ]; then
    SYNC_SH="$candidate"
    break
  fi
done

if [ -z "$SYNC_SH" ]; then
  echo "⛔ vgflow-repo sync.sh not found."
  echo "   Setup options:"
  echo "   1. Set env: export VGFLOW_REPO=/path/to/vgflow-repo"
  echo "   2. Clone sibling: git clone https://github.com/vietdev99/vgflow ../vgflow-repo"
  echo "   Then re-run /vg:sync"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✓ Using sync script: $SYNC_SH"
export DEV_ROOT="$(pwd)"
```
</step>

<step name="1_run_sync">
Parse args: `--check` (dry-run), `--no-source` (skip source→mirror), `--no-global` (skip ~/.codex)

```bash
bash "$SYNC_SH" $ARGUMENTS
```

Output shows:
- Files changed (new/updated)
- Summary count
- Dry-run indication nếu --check

Exit code:
- 0: nothing to do OR sync applied
- 1 (with --check): drift detected, needs sync
</step>

<step name="2_report">
After apply (not --check), surface:
- Số files synced
- Locations touched
- Nếu có global deploy: remind user Codex sessions hiện tại cần restart để load skills mới

Nếu --check báo drift:
- Suggest: `/vg:sync` (without --check) để apply
- Hoặc `/vg:sync --no-global` nếu không muốn deploy global
</step>
