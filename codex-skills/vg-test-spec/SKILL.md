## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Runtime lock

When this skill is running inside Codex, DO NOT switch to Claude CLI to execute
the workflow entrypoint. Keep the current Codex runtime, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`, use Codex `update_plan` for the compact visible task
window, and bind it with `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter codex`.

VGFlow source paths are resolved through global `VG_HOME` (default:
`~/.vgflow`). Project-local Claude workflow files may be absent in
global-only installs; Codex must use
`${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/scripts}` and
`${VG_COMMAND_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/commands/vg}` for workflow
helpers. References below to "Claude CLI", `TodoWrite`, or Haiku describe
the Claude adapter only. Codex must map them through this adapter contract
instead of aborting the current run and relaunching Claude.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `${VG_COMMAND_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/commands/vg}/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Compact Codex plan window + orchestrator step markers | Use `tasklist-contract.json` as source of truth. Do not paste the full hierarchy into Codex `update_plan`. Show at most 6 rows: active group/step first, next 2-3 pending steps, completed groups collapsed, and `+N pending`. After projecting, emit `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter codex`. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `${VG_COMMAND_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/commands/vg}/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash "${VG_COMMAND_ROOT:-${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}/commands/vg}/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh" \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-test-spec`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.
</codex_skill_adapter>

<HARD-GATE-CODEX>
Codex has no Claude PreToolUse/PostToolUse hook substrate. Claude hooks may
auto-emit step markers, but Codex MUST emit the same hard markers explicitly
after each matching STEP primary action.

Use global VGFlow paths (${VG_HOME}/scripts and ${VG_HOME}/commands/vg)
so global-only installs work without project-local copies:

```bash
VG_HOME="${VG_HOME:-$HOME/.vgflow}"
VG_SCRIPT_ROOT="${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT:-${VG_HOME}/scripts}"
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step test-spec 0_parse_and_validate
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step test-spec 1_build_artifact_gate
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step test-spec 2_generate_deep_specs
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step test-spec 3_validate_deep_specs
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step test-spec 3_crossai_sweep
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step test-spec 4_codegen
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step test-spec 4_self_review
"${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" "${VG_SCRIPT_ROOT}/vg-orchestrator" mark-step test-spec 5_complete
```

Hook/spawn mechanics may differ by provider, but marker names, order, gates,
must-write artifacts, and telemetry contract stay identical to the Claude
command source.

<LANGUAGE_POLICY>
Follow `_shared/language-policy.md`. Default narration is Vietnamese; file
paths, command names, JSON keys, and code identifiers stay English.
</LANGUAGE_POLICY>

<objective>
Run the dedicated deep test-spec lane after `/vg:build` and before
`/vg:review`.

Why this exists:
- Blueprint is too early: implemented DOM, route files, API handlers, generated
  UI, and concrete form state may not exist yet.
- Build must not self-certify runtime coverage.
- Review should verify runtime against a pre-authored deep spec contract, not
  discover test depth late and route it ambiguously.

Pipeline:
`specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test-spec → test → accept`
</objective>

<rules>
1. This command is post-build only. Missing `SUMMARY*.md`, `BUILD-LOG.md`, or
   `.build-progress.json` BLOCKs with guidance to run `/vg:build`.
2. It authors test-depth contracts, not executable test specs. Executable
   specs still belong to `/vg:test`.
3. Mutation and multi-actor goals must get closed-loop RCRURDR coverage:
   read_before → create → read_after_create → update → read_after_update →
   delete → read_after_delete.
4. Fixture dependencies must be explicit: actors, sessions, resource ownership,
   artifact sinks, cleanup order.
5. VG is profile-aware. Web may use Playwright, mobile may use Maestro/Appium/native,
   CLI may use command assertions, backend may use HTTP/RPC/job checks, library may
   use unit/property tests.
6. Review consumes these artifacts. If review finds runtime blockers, stay in
   review/debug. If runtime is clean but executable specs are missing, route to
   `/vg:test`.

## Step 3.5: CrossAI sweep (`3_crossai_sweep`)

Test-spec is the ONLY post-build artifact phase without CrossAI semantic review.
Deterministic validators (`verify-lifecycle-spec-depth.py`, `verify-deep-test-specs.py`)
catch SYNTAX gaps. They cannot catch SEMANTIC gaps — missing actors on multi-actor
goals, preconditions that contradict API contracts, fixture DAG cycles, RCRURDR
transition skips, cleanup order errors.

This step adds an adversarial gap-hunt sweep over LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json +
TEST-FIXTURE-DAG.json + TEST-EXECUTION-PLAN.json + DEEP-TEST-SPECS.md. Reuses
the shared `crossai-invoke.md` invoker (same pattern as `blueprint/verify.md:550+`).

### Trigger rules (Option B + A)

Flag precedence (highest first):
1. `--no-crossai-review` in `$ARGUMENTS` → SKIP unconditionally. Emit
   `test_spec.crossai_skipped` with reason `operator-override`.
2. `--crossai-review` in `$ARGUMENTS` → FORCE on regardless of profile / goals.
3. Auto-trigger condition (Option B):
   - ANY goal in LIFECYCLE-SPECS.json has `goal_type` containing `mutation` OR
     `multi-actor` OR `realtime` OR `financial` (high-stakes semantic surface)
   - OR `verify-lifecycle-spec-depth.py` previously returned WARN (not BLOCK)
   - OR profile in `{mobile, realtime, fintech}` from `vg.config.md`
   - **Batch 46 F12:** OR `verify-manifest-spec-kinds.py` reports any goal
     lacking edge OR negative spec_kind in CODEGEN-MANIFEST.json (manifest
     spec_kind gap) — deterministic gates pass on happy-only manifests;
     semantic review must catch the missing failure-mode coverage.
   → FIRE the sweep.
4. None of the above → SKIP with reason `low-stakes-profile`. Emit
   `test_spec.crossai_skipped`.

<step name="4_codegen">

## Step 4: codegen (`4_codegen`)

Spawn `vg-test-codegen` subagent to generate Playwright lifecycle specs per goal. Smart-routing applies lens set per `goal_type` from `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.json`.

**Smart-routing lens map:**

| `goal_type` | Lens set |
|---|---|
| `mutation` | `idor` + `mass-assignment` + `authz-negative` + `business-logic` |
| `read` | `authz` + `info-disclosure` + `tenant-boundary` |
| `auth` | `auth-jwt` + `csrf` + `duplicate-submit` |
| `default` | `business-coherence` + `input-injection` |

**Subagent invocation:**

Read `commands/vg/_shared/test/codegen/delegation.md` and `commands/vg/_shared/test/codegen/overview.md` (existing files, no change). Then:

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="vg-test-codegen",
  prompt=<from delegation.md template>,
  input={
    phase_dir: "${PHASE_DIR}",
    phase_number: "${PHASE_NUMBER}",
    phase_profile: "${PHASE_PROFILE}",
    runtime_map_path: "${PHASE_DIR}/RUNTIME-MAP.json",
    goal_coverage_matrix_path: "${PHASE_DIR}/GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.json",
    generated_tests_dir: "tests/e2e/lifecycle/",
    lens_routing_map: <smart-routing map above>
  }
)
```

**Output contract:**
- `tests/e2e/lifecycle/G-XX.{lens}.spec.ts` — one file per goal × lens
- `${PHASE_DIR}/CODEGEN-MANIFEST.json` — list of generated files + their L1/L2 binding state
