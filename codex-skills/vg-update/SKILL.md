## Codex runtime notes

This skill body is generated from VGFlow's canonical source. Claude Code and
Codex use the same workflow contracts, but their orchestration primitives differ.

### Runtime lock

When this skill is running inside Codex, DO NOT switch to Claude CLI to execute
the workflow entrypoint. Keep the current Codex runtime, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`, use Codex `update_plan` for the compact visible task
window, and bind it with `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter codex`.

`.claude/scripts/*` and `.claude/commands/*` are canonical VGFlow source
paths shared by both adapters; those paths do not mean the runtime changed to
Claude. References below to "Claude CLI", `TodoWrite`, or Haiku describe the
Claude adapter only. Codex must map them through this adapter contract instead
of aborting the current run and relaunching Claude.

### Tool mapping

| Claude Code concept | Codex-compatible pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AskUserQuestion | Ask concise questions in the main Codex thread | Codex does not expose the same structured prompt tool inside generated skills. Persist answers where the skill requires it; prefer Codex-native options such as `codex-inline` when the source prompt distinguishes providers. |
| Agent(...) / Task | Prefer `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh` or native Codex subagents | Use `codex exec` when exact model, timeout, output file, or schema control matters. |
| TaskCreate / TaskUpdate / TodoWrite | Compact Codex plan window + orchestrator step markers | Use `tasklist-contract.json` as source of truth. Do not paste the full hierarchy into Codex `update_plan`. Show at most 6 rows: active group/step first, next 2-3 pending steps, completed groups collapsed, and `+N pending`. After projecting, emit `vg-orchestrator tasklist-projected --adapter codex`. |
| Playwright MCP | Main Codex orchestrator MCP tools, or smoke-tested subagents | If an MCP-using subagent cannot access tools in a target environment, fall back to orchestrator-driven/inline scanner flow. |
| Graphify MCP | Python/CLI graphify calls | VGFlow's build/review paths already use deterministic scripts where possible. |

<codex_runtime_contract>
### Provider/runtime parity contract

This generated skill must preserve the source command's artifacts, gates,
telemetry events, and step ordering on both Claude and Codex. Do not remove,
skip, or weaken a source workflow step because a Claude-only primitive appears
in the body below.

#### Provider mapping

| Source pattern | Claude path | Codex path |
|---|---|---|
| Planner/research/checker Agent | Use the source `Agent(...)` call and configured model tier | Use native Codex subagents only if the local Codex version has been smoke-tested; otherwise write the child prompt to a temp file and call `commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` |
| Build executor Agent | Use the source executor `Agent(...)` call | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor --sandbox workspace-write` with explicit file ownership and expected artifact output |
| Adversarial/CrossAI reviewer | Use configured external CLIs and consensus validators | Use configured `codex exec`/Gemini/Claude commands from `.claude/vg.config.md`; fail if required CLI output is missing or unparsable |
| Haiku scanner / Playwright / Maestro / MCP-heavy work | Use Claude subagents where the source command requires them | Keep MCP-heavy work in the main Codex orchestrator unless child MCP access was smoke-tested; scanner work may run inline/sequential instead of parallel, but must write the same scan artifacts and events |
| Reflection / learning | Use `vg-reflector` workflow | Use the Codex `vg-reflector` adapter or `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner`; candidates still require the same user gate |

### Codex hook parity

Claude Code has a project-local hook substrate; Codex skills do not receive
Claude `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `PostToolUse` hooks automatically.
Therefore Codex must execute the lifecycle explicitly through the same
orchestrator that writes `.vg/events.db`:

| Claude hook | What it does on Claude | Codex obligation |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` -> `vg-entry-hook.py` | Pre-seeds `vg-orchestrator run-start` and `.vg/.session-context.json` before the skill loads | Treat the command body's explicit `vg-orchestrator run-start` as mandatory; if missing or failing, BLOCK before doing work |
| `Stop` -> `vg-verify-claim.py` | Runs `vg-orchestrator run-complete` and blocks false done claims | Run the command body's terminal `vg-orchestrator run-complete` before claiming completion; if it returns non-zero, fix evidence and retry |
| `PostToolUse` edit -> `vg-edit-warn.py` | Warns that command/skill edits require session reload | After editing VG workflow files on Codex, tell the user the current session may still use cached skill text |
| `PostToolUse` Bash -> `vg-step-tracker.py` | Tracks marker commands and emits `hook.step_active` telemetry | Do not rely on the hook; call explicit `vg-orchestrator mark-step` lines in the skill and preserve marker/telemetry events |

Codex hook parity is evidence-based: `.vg/events.db`, step markers,
`must_emit_telemetry`, and `run-complete` output are authoritative. A Codex
run is not complete just because the model says it is complete.

Before executing command bash blocks from a Codex skill, export
`VG_RUNTIME=codex`. This is an adapter signal, not a source replacement:
Claude/unknown runtime keeps the canonical `AskUserQuestion` + Haiku path,
while Codex maps only the incompatible orchestration primitives to
Codex-native choices such as `codex-inline`.

### Codex spawn precedence

When the source workflow below says `Agent(...)` or "spawn", Codex MUST
apply this table instead of treating the Claude syntax as executable:

| Source spawn site | Codex action | Tier/model env | Sandbox | Required evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/vg:build` wave executor, `model="${MODEL_EXECUTOR}"` | Write one prompt file per task, run `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor`; parallelize independent tasks with background processes and `wait`, serialize dependency groups | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`; leave unset to use Codex config default. Set this to the user's strongest coding model when they want Sonnet-class build quality. | `workspace-write` | child output, stdout/stderr logs, changed files, verification commands, task-fidelity prompt evidence |
| `/vg:blueprint`, `/vg:scope`, planner/checker agents | Run `codex-spawn.sh --tier planner` or inline in the main orchestrator if the step needs interactive user answers | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` | `workspace-write` for artifact-writing planners, `read-only` for pure checks | requested artifacts or JSON verdict |
| `/vg:review` navigator/scanner, `Agent(model="haiku")` | Use `--scanner=codex-inline` by default. Do NOT ask to spawn Haiku or blindly spawn `codex exec` for Playwright/Maestro work. Main Codex orchestrator owns MCP/browser/device actions. Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner --sandbox read-only` only for non-MCP classification over captured snapshots/artifacts. | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`; set this to a cheap/fast model for review map/scanner work | `read-only` unless explicitly generating scan files from supplied evidence | same `scan-*.json`, `RUNTIME-MAP.json`, `GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md`, and `review.haiku_scanner_spawned` telemetry event semantics |
| `/vg:review` fix agents and `/vg:test` codegen agents | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier executor` because they edit code/tests | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` or explicit `--model` if the command selected a configured fix model | `workspace-write` | changed files, tests run, unresolved risks |
| Rationalization guard, reflector, gap hunters | Use `codex-spawn.sh --tier scanner` for read-only classification, or `--tier adversarial` for independent challenge/review | `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` or `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` | `read-only` by default | compact JSON/markdown verdict; fail closed on empty/unparseable output |

If a source sentence says "MUST spawn Haiku" and the step needs MCP/browser
tools, Codex interprets that as "MUST run the scanner protocol and emit the
same artifacts/events"; it does not require a child process unless child MCP
access was smoke-tested in the current environment.

#### Non-negotiable guarantees

- Never skip source workflow gates, validators, telemetry events, or must-write artifacts.
- If Codex cannot emulate a Claude primitive safely, BLOCK instead of silently degrading.
- UI/UX, security, and business-flow checks remain artifact/gate driven: follow the source command's DESIGN/UI-MAP/TEST-GOALS/security validator requirements exactly.
- A slower Codex inline path is acceptable; a weaker path that omits evidence is not.
</codex_runtime_contract>

### Model tier mapping

Model mapping is tier-based, not vendor-name-based.

VGFlow keeps tier names in `.claude/vg.config.md`; Codex subprocesses use
the user's Codex config model by default. Pin a tier only after smoke-testing
that model in the target account, via `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER`,
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR`, `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER`, or
`VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`:

| VG tier | Claude-style role | Codex default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| planner | Opus-class planning/reasoning | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_PLANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| executor | Sonnet-class coding/review | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_EXECUTOR` only after smoke-testing |
| scanner | Haiku-class scan/classify | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_SCANNER` only after smoke-testing |
| adversarial | independent reviewer | Codex config default | Set `VG_CODEX_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL` only after smoke-testing |

### Spawn helper

For subprocess-based children, use:

```bash
bash .claude/commands/vg/_shared/lib/codex-spawn.sh \
  --tier executor \
  --prompt-file "$PROMPT_FILE" \
  --out "$OUT_FILE" \
  --timeout 900 \
  --sandbox workspace-write
```

The helper wraps `codex exec`, writes the final message to `--out`, captures
stdout/stderr beside it, and fails loudly on timeout or empty output.

### Known Codex caveats to design around

- Do not trust inline model selection for native subagents unless verified in the current Codex version; use TOML-pinned agents or `codex exec --model`.
- Do not combine structured `--output-schema` with MCP-heavy runs until the target Codex version is smoke-tested. Prefer plain text + post-parse for MCP flows.
- Recursive `codex exec` runs inherit sandbox constraints. Use the least sandbox that still allows the child to write expected artifacts.

### Support-skill MCP pattern

Pattern A: INLINE ORCHESTRATOR. For MCP-heavy support skills such as
`vg-haiku-scanner`, Codex keeps Playwright/Maestro actions in the main
orchestrator and only delegates read-only classification after snapshots are
captured. This preserves MCP access and avoids false confidence from a child
process that cannot see browser tools.

## Invocation

Invoke this skill as `$vg-update`. Treat all user text after the skill name as arguments.
</codex_skill_adapter>

<rules>
1. **Atomic** — VERSION file + ancestor dir rotated only after all merges complete.
2. **Non-destructive on conflict** — conflicted files are parked under `.claude/vgflow-patches/`, never clobber user edits.
3. **All logic in Python** — this markdown wraps `.claude/scripts/vg_update.py`; no version math / SHA / merge logic in bash.
4. **Honor repo override** — `--repo=owner/name` flag flows through to `vg_update.py`.
5. **Honor args literally** — use `${ARGUMENTS}`, never `$*`/`$@` to avoid arg splitting.
</rules>

<objective>
Sync local VG install (`.claude/commands/vg/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/scripts/`, `.claude/templates/`)
to latest GitHub release of `vietdev99/vgflow`. Logic lives in `.claude/scripts/vg_update.py`.
High-level flow:

1. Preflight: verify `git`, `curl`, `python3`, helper script present.
2. `--check` mode → just print version state + exit.
3. Query `GET /repos/{repo}/releases/latest` via helper → compare with `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION`.
4. Show changelog preview for versions `> installed, <= latest`.
5. Ask user to confirm.
6. Breaking-change gate: major bump requires `--accept-breaking` + shows migration doc.
7. Download tarball + verify SHA256 + extract to `.vgflow-cache/v{ver}/`.
8. Walk extracted tree, 3-way merge each file against `.claude/vgflow-ancestor/v{installed}/`.
9. Clean merges → apply; conflicts → `.claude/vgflow-patches/{rel}.conflict` + manifest entry.
10. Rotate ancestor dir + bump `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION`.
11. Sync Codex mirrors directly from the updated release assets.
12. Verify/repair Claude + Codex Playwright MCP workers (`playwright1`..`playwright5`).
13. Verify/install Graphify tooling when `graphify.enabled=true`.
14. Report counts + restart reminder.
</objective>

<process>

### Preflight section (extracted v2.73.0 T6)

Read `_shared/update/preflight.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 2 steps: 0_preflight (verify git/curl/python3 + helper script present, parse --repo= flag) and 1_check_only_mode (handle --check flag — print version state + exit).

Step coverage: 0_preflight, 1_check_only_mode.

### Version + changelog (extracted v2.73.0 T7)

Read `_shared/update/version-and-changelog.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 3 steps: 2_version_compare (query latest release via helper, parse installed/latest/state), 3_changelog_preview (fetch + filter CHANGELOG entries between installed and latest, ask user to confirm via AskUserQuestion), and 4_breaking_gate (major-bump opt-in via --accept-breaking + migration doc display + deep compat scan).

Step coverage: 2_version_compare, 3_changelog_preview, 4_breaking_gate.

CODEX NOTE: Step 3's confirmation prompt uses AskUserQuestion on Claude. On Codex, ask the same Yes/No question inline in the main Codex thread per the adapter contract above (Tool mapping table).

### Fetch + merge (extracted v2.73.0 T8)

Read `_shared/update/fetch-and-merge.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 3 steps: 5_fetch_tarball (download + verify SHA256 + extract via helper, self-bootstrap to upstream vg_update.py), 6_three_way_merge_per_file (walk extracted tree, 3-way merge each file vs ancestor, park conflicts to .claude/vgflow-patches/, force-upstream when ancestor missing, refuse VERSION bump on core update-tooling drift), and 6b_verify_gate_integrity (T8 hard-gate manifest re-hash + diff, soft-skip on pre-v1.8.0 404).

Step coverage: 5_fetch_tarball, 6_three_way_merge_per_file, 6b_verify_gate_integrity.

### Rotate + repair (extracted v2.73.0 T9)

Read `_shared/update/rotate-and-repair.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 2 steps: 7_rotate_ancestor_and_version (remove old ancestor stash, move extracted upstream into new vgflow-ancestor/v{LATEST}, atomic VGFLOW-VERSION bump) and 7b_repair_hooks (re-install Claude hooks via install-hooks.sh + prune legacy VG entries from settings.local.json to prevent v2.50.x double-hook drift).

Step coverage: 7_rotate_ancestor_and_version, 7b_repair_hooks.

### Sync + report (extracted v2.73.0 T10 — final)

Read `_shared/update/sync-and-report.md` and follow it exactly.
Includes 4 closing steps: 8_sync_codex (deploy Codex skills + agents + templates from rotated release ancestor into .codex/ via tri-state VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX [auto-detect prior project install by default; 1=force, 0=opt-out], optional global ~/.codex via tri-state VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX [auto-detect prior global install by default; 1=force, 0=opt-out], verify mirror equivalence), 8b_repair_playwright_mcp (verify/repair playwright1-5 MCP workers via verify-playwright-mcp-config.py), 8c_ensure_graphify (verify/install Graphify tooling when graphify.enabled=true, soft-fail), and 9_report (final counts + NEXT_ACTION directive when conflicts parked, restart reminder).

Step coverage: 8_sync_codex, 8b_repair_playwright_mcp, 8c_ensure_graphify, 9_report.

CODEX NOTE: The final report's AI directive (`▶ NEXT_ACTION=/vg:reapply-patches[ --verify-gates]`) is runtime-agnostic — Codex MUST chain into /vg:reapply-patches in the next turn when CONFLICTS > 0 OR gate-conflicts.md exists, without waiting for a fresh user prompt (matches Claude behavior).

</process>

<success_criteria>
- `/vg:update --check` prints `current=... latest=... state=...` and exits cleanly.
- Non-check run: shows changelog preview, asks confirmation, either applies or exits on cancel.
- Clean merges applied silently; conflicts parked to `.claude/vgflow-patches/{rel}.conflict` with manifest entry.
- Major-version bump blocked unless `--accept-breaking` is passed AND migration doc displayed.
- `.claude/VGFLOW-VERSION` bumped to `${LATEST}`; old `vgflow-ancestor/v{INSTALLED}` removed; new `vgflow-ancestor/v{LATEST}` populated.
- Claude Code hooks are installed/repaired after update (`UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, `PostToolUse` edit warning, `PostToolUse` Bash step tracker).
- Project-local Codex mirrors in `.codex/skills` and `.codex/agents` are refreshed from the updated release assets only when project install is detected (presence of `.codex/skills/vg-update`) OR `VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX=1` is set. Set `VG_UPDATE_PROJECT_CODEX=0` to permanently opt the project out (useful when keeping vgflow in `~/.codex` global only). Global `~/.codex` deploy follows the same auto-detect rule via `VG_UPDATE_GLOBAL_CODEX` (auto-detects prior global install; `1`/`0` to force/skip). Both env vars default to `auto` for symmetric, non-destructive behavior.
- Functional Codex mirror equivalence is verified after update; drift without merge conflicts fails the update.
- Playwright MCP workers are verified/repaired after update for both Claude and Codex (`playwright1`..`playwright5`) and stale hardcoded lock scripts are replaced.
- Graphify tooling is verified/repaired after update when `graphify.enabled=true`; missing package installs `graphifyy[mcp]`, `.mcp.json` is repaired, and `.graphifyignore` / `.gitignore` are maintained.
- Final report lists updated / new / conflict counts. When `CONFLICTS > 0` OR `gate-conflicts.md` exists, the report emits a runtime-agnostic AI directive (`▶ NEXT_ACTION=/vg:reapply-patches[ --verify-gates]`) instructing the assistant to chain into `/vg:reapply-patches` in the next turn without waiting for a fresh user prompt. Applies to Claude Code and Codex.
- Meta files (VERSION, CHANGELOG.md, README.md, LICENSE, install.sh, sync.sh, vg.config.template.md) never written to `.claude/`.
