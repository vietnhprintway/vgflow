# build waves delegation contract (vg-build-task-executor subagent)

<!-- # Exception: contract document, not step ref — H1/HARD-GATE not required.
     This ref describes a JSON envelope + prompt template + return contract
     for the `vg-build-task-executor` subagent. It has no `step-active` /
     `mark-step` lifecycle of its own — the orchestrator's `waves-overview.md`
     STEP 4 owns those. The reviewer audit (B1/B2 FAIL) flagged the missing
     `# build <name> (STEP N)` H1 + top HARD-GATE; both are intentionally
     absent because this file is a contract, not an executable step body. -->

This file contains the input envelope, prompt template, and output JSON
contract for `Agent(subagent_type="vg-build-task-executor", prompt=...)`.

Read `waves-overview.md` for the orchestrator-side responsibilities
(pre-spawn checklist, capsule materialization, spawn site narration,
post-spawn aggregation). This file describes ONLY the spawn payload +
return contract.

The shapes below are LOAD-BEARING for Task 10 (`vg-build-task-executor`
SKILL.md). Drift here breaks the subagent's input parser and the
orchestrator's return validator. Do not change field names.

---

## Input contract (the JSON envelope)

The orchestrator constructs this envelope per task before rendering the
prompt template below. All paths are absolute or `${PHASE_DIR}`-rooted.
The envelope is conceptual — the actual transport is the rendered prompt
text the orchestrator passes as the `prompt=` argument to the Agent
tool. The subagent recovers structured fields by reading the named
files (capsule, plan slice, contract slices, design ref).

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-04",
  "wave_id": 3,
  "phase_number": "${PHASE_NUMBER}",
  "phase_dir": "${PHASE_DIR}",
  "capsule_path": ".task-capsules/task-04.capsule.json",
  "plan_task_path": "${PHASE_DIR}/PLAN/task-04.md",
  "contract_slice_paths": [
    "${PHASE_DIR}/API-CONTRACTS/sites-create.md",
    "${PHASE_DIR}/API-CONTRACTS/sites-list.md"
  ],
  "interface_standards_md_path": "${PHASE_DIR}/INTERFACE-STANDARDS.md",
  "design_ref_path": "${PHASE_DIR}/design/sites-list-table.png",
  "wave_context_path": "${PHASE_DIR}/wave-3-context.md",
  "typecheck_cmd": "pnpm typecheck",
  "build_cmd": "pnpm build",

    "G-04",
    "G-12"
  ],
  "crud_surfaces_slice_path": ".task-capsules/task-04.crud-surfaces.md",
  "lens_walk_slice_path": ".task-capsules/task-04.lens-walk.md",
  "rcrurd_invariants_paths": [
    "${PHASE_DIR}/RCRURD-INVARIANTS/G-04.yaml",
    "${PHASE_DIR}/RCRURD-INVARIANTS/G-12.yaml"
  ],
  "bootstrap_rules": [
    /* Resolved by orchestrator pre-spawn (Task 11 — L1 scope-matched).
       Pseudocode (driven from .claude/scripts/lib/rule_resolver.py):
         from rule_resolver import resolve_rules
         rules = resolve_rules(
           rules_file=Path(".vg/BOOTSTRAP-RULES.yaml"),
           task_files=<list of files this task touches>,
         )
       Each rule has: rule_id, severity (BLOCK|TRIAGE_REQUIRED|ADVISORY),
       enforce (human-readable instruction), verification (cmd kind),
       verification_arg (cmd argument). Subagent MUST honor BLOCK/TRIAGE_REQUIRED
       rules; ADVISORY are informational. Replaces the legacy "dump every memory
       rule into capsule" behavior — only rules whose scope_match matches the
       task's files are injected. */
  ],
  "workflow_slice_path": "${PHASE_DIR}/WORKFLOW-SPECS/WF-001.md"
}
```

**Field semantics:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | yes | Full ID like `task-04`. Spawn-guard reads this from prompt to validate against `.spawn-count.json`'s `remaining[]`. |
| `wave_id` | yes | Integer wave number for narration + commit message tag. |
| `phase_number` | yes | e.g. `7.14`. Used in commit message `feat(7.14-04): ...`. |
| `phase_dir` | yes | Absolute path. Subagent reads files relative to this. |
| `capsule_path` | yes | `.task-capsules/task-${N}.capsule.json` written by `pre-executor-check.py`. PreToolUse Agent hook BLOCKS spawn if this file is missing. |
| `plan_task_path` | yes | Per-task split file. Subagent loads via `vg-load --artifact plan --task NN`. |
| `contract_slice_paths` | maybe | List of per-endpoint contract slices. Empty when task touches no API. |
| `interface_standards_md_path` | yes | Phase API/FE/CLI envelope contract. Subagent MUST follow before local preference. |
| `design_ref_path` | maybe | Resolved PNG from L1 design-pixel gate. Present when task has `<design-ref>`. NULL otherwise. |
| `wave_context_path` | yes | `${PHASE_DIR}/wave-{N}-context.md` listing wave-mate field alignment. |
| `typecheck_cmd` | yes | From `vg.config.md > build_gates.typecheck_cmd`. Subagent runs before commit. |
| `build_cmd` | maybe | From `vg.config.md > build_gates.build_cmd`. May be empty. |
| `binding_requirements` | yes | Citations the subagent's commit MUST satisfy via `// vg-binding: <id>` comments + commit-msg cite. |
| `edge_cases_for_goals` | maybe | List of goal IDs (G-NN) whose EDGE-CASES this task implements. Subagent MUST load via `vg-load --artifact edge-cases --goal G-NN` and handle each variant_id in code. Empty list = task touches no goals (rare, e.g., infra/migration tasks). |
| `crud_surfaces_slice_path` | maybe | Pre-resolved CRUD-SURFACES slice for resources this task touches. NULL when task has no API endpoints OR phase predates Task 37. Subagent reads via `cat $crud_surfaces_slice_path` (file is concatenation of per-resource slices). |
| `lens_walk_slice_path` | maybe | Pre-resolved LENS-WALK slice for goals this task implements. NULL when task touches no goals OR phase has no `LENS-WALK/`. Subagent loads to understand bug-class probe variants. |
| `rcrurd_invariants_paths` | maybe | List of per-goal RCRURD-INVARIANTS yaml paths (Task 22 schema, Task 39 RCRURDR extension). One entry per goal. Empty list = no invariants apply. Subagent MUST honor `lifecycle: rcrurd \| rcrurdr \| partial` when emitting test code or handler ordering. |
| `bootstrap_rules` | maybe | Scope-matched rule cards from `.vg/BOOTSTRAP-RULES.yaml` resolved by `rule_resolver.resolve_rules()`. Empty list = no rules apply to this task's files. Subagent reads `severity` field — BLOCK/TRIAGE_REQUIRED rules MUST be honored before commit; ADVISORY are informational. |
| `workflow_slice_path` | maybe | `${PHASE_DIR}/WORKFLOW-SPECS/${capsule.workflow_id}.md` when capsule.workflow_id present, else NULL. Orchestrator pre-resolves before spawn. Subagent reads via `cat $workflow_slice_path` or via `vg-load --artifact workflow --workflow ${capsule.workflow_id}`. |

## Prompt template

The orchestrator renders the template below (substituting `${...}` from
its environment + the per-task envelope above) and passes the result as
the `prompt` argument to the Agent tool call.

# ============================================================
# PROCEDURE — execute these steps in order
# ============================================================

1. **Read capsule** at `${capsule_path}`. Validate required fields
   present (`task_context`, `contract_context`, `goals_context`,
   `sibling_context`, `downstream_callers`, `build_config`). If any
   required field is missing or empty, return error JSON immediately:
   `{"error": "capsule_field_missing", "field": "<name>", "task_id": "${task_id}"}`.

2. **Implement** per the `<task_plan_slice>` body. Touch ONLY the files
   listed in the task's `<file-path>` / `<edits-*>` attributes. Do not
   refactor unrelated code.

3. **Add binding markers** — for each modified source file, add a
   `// vg-binding: <id>` comment (or language-appropriate equivalent:
   `# vg-binding:` for Python, `<!-- vg-binding: -->` for HTML/MD)
   covering each entry in `binding_requirements`.

4. **Run typecheck**: `${typecheck_cmd}`. If exit code != 0, return
   error JSON: `{"error": "typecheck_failed", "stderr": "<tail>", "task_id": "${task_id}"}`.
   Do NOT commit on typecheck failure.

5. **Self-review diff before commit (v2.66.1 B2 reminder).** Per
   `.claude/agents/vg-build-task-executor/SKILL.md` `<SELF-REVIEW>`,
   read full `git diff` + verify the 7-item checklist (no scope creep,
   tests present, mirror byte-identity, no VERSION bump, no
   `--no-verify` / `--amend`, test count matches spec). Fix any issue
   BEFORE staging — do not commit-then-amend.

6. **Stage + commit** — exactly ONE commit. Multiple commits are caught
   by post-spawn R5 check (`git log --oneline ${prev_sha}..HEAD | wc -l > 1`).
   Commit message format:
     `<type>(${phase_number}-${task_num}): <subject>`
     where type ∈ {feat, fix, refactor, test, chore}
   Body MUST cite each binding: `Per CONTEXT.md D-XX` or
   `Per INTERFACE-STANDARDS § <section>`.
   NO `--no-verify` on `apps/**/src/**`, `packages/**/src/**`.

7. **Write fingerprint** at `${phase_dir}/.fingerprints/task-${task_id}.fingerprint.md`
   summarizing files touched, line count delta, gate evidence (typecheck
   exit code, test count). Format per `vg-executor-rules.md § Fingerprint`.

8. **Write read-evidence** at `${phase_dir}/.read-evidence/task-${task_id}.json`
   IF `design_ref_path` was present in input. JSON must contain:
   ```json
   {
     "design_ref_path": "...",
     "read_at": "ISO-8601",
     "screenshot_sha256": "...",
     "rendered_components": ["..."]
   }
   ```
   If `design_ref_path` was NULL (non-UI task), DO NOT create this file —
   the post-spawn validator will check both directions.

9. **Return JSON** to the orchestrator (see Output JSON contract below).
````

**Rendering notes for the orchestrator:**

- `${BOOTSTRAP_RULES_BLOCK}` comes from `vg_bootstrap_render_block` in
  `bootstrap-inject.sh` (target_step="build").
- `${CONTRACT_SLICE_BLOCKS}` is built by joining `@<path>` lines for
  each entry in `contract_slice_paths` (one per endpoint).
- `${DESIGN_REF_BLOCK}` is `@${design_ref_path}` when present, else the
  literal string `NONE — non-UI task`.
- `${BINDING_REQUIREMENTS_LIST}` is a markdown bullet list of the
  `binding_requirements` array.
- `${WORKFLOW_SLICE_BLOCK}` is `@${workflow_slice_path}` when `capsule.workflow_id` is
  present (workflow_id != null), else the literal string `NONE — non-workflow task`.
  The orchestrator pre-resolves `workflow_slice_path` to
  `${PHASE_DIR}/WORKFLOW-SPECS/${capsule.workflow_id}.md` before spawn.

The full rendered prompt is also persisted to
`${PHASE_DIR}/.build/wave-${wave_id}/executor-prompts/${task_id}.prompt.md`
for the D-06 task-fidelity audit (post-spawn 3-way hash compare).

### B87 v4.65.0 — IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.html append directive (REQUIRED)

The orchestrator MUST append the following block to every rendered executor
prompt BEFORE spawning the subagent. The vg-build-task-executor SKILL.md
documents the syntax in detail; the prompt-level reminder ensures the
agent sees it even when SKILL.md is not in its context window.

```text
ADDITIONAL TASK-EXECUTION RULE — IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.html (B87):

If during this task you (1) make a decision beyond what specs explicitly
say, (2) change a binding_requirement, (3) consider ≥2 options before
choosing one, or (4) produce anything the operator needs to know to review
your code, append an <article> block to
${PHASE_DIR}/IMPLEMENTATION-NOTES.html BEFORE marking the task done.

Insert your article BEFORE the closing </main> tag. The HTML comment at
the top of the file documents the exact syntax. Each <article> must have
≥1 substantive section (≥50 chars, non-N/A) among class="what",
class="why", class="tradeoff".

NEVER embed raw <script> tags. Wrap snippets in <code> or <pre>.
NEVER corrupt the document end (...</main></body></html>).
```

## Output JSON contract (subagent returns)

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-04",
  "artifacts_written": [
    "src/foo.ts",
    "tests/foo.spec.ts"
  ],
  "commit_sha": "abc123def4567890",
  "bindings_satisfied": [
    "binding-CONTEXT-D-02",
    "binding-INTERFACE-error-shape"
  ],
  "fingerprint_path": "${PHASE_DIR}/.fingerprints/task-04.fingerprint.md",
  "read_evidence_path": "${PHASE_DIR}/.read-evidence/task-04.json",
  "build_log_path": "${PHASE_DIR}/BUILD-LOG/task-04.md",
  "warnings": []
}
```

**Field semantics:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `task_id` | yes | MUST match the input `task_id` exactly. Mismatch = orchestrator rejects return. |
| `artifacts_written` | yes | List of repo-relative paths the subagent created or modified. Each MUST exist on disk at return time. |
| `commit_sha` | yes | Full or short SHA of the single commit this task produced. Orchestrator validates `git rev-parse <sha>` succeeds. |
| `bindings_satisfied` | yes | Subset of input `binding_requirements` the subagent satisfied. Empty = task plan binding requirements not met. |
| `fingerprint_path` | yes | Path written in step 6 of procedure. Must exist on disk. |
| `read_evidence_path` | maybe | Path written in step 7. NULL when no `design_ref_path` was passed. |
| `build_log_path` | yes | Path written by subagent procedure step 13 — `${PHASE_DIR}/BUILD-LOG/task-${task_id}.md`. R1a UX baseline Req 1 layer 1 (per-task split). Orchestrator validates the file exists on disk before marking task complete. Post-executor (Task 11) concats every `BUILD-LOG/task-*.md` into Layer 3 `BUILD-LOG.md`; missing this file breaks aggregation. |
| `warnings` | optional | Non-blocking issues the subagent surfaces (e.g., flaky test re-tried, deprecated API used). |

**Error return format** (any procedure step failure):

```json
{
  "error": "<machine-readable error code>",
  "task_id": "task-04",
  "details": "<one-line human-readable cause>",
  "stderr": "<command stderr tail when applicable>"
}
```

The orchestrator narrates failure via:
```bash
bash scripts/vg-narrate-spawn.sh vg-build-task-executor failed "task-${N}: <error>"
```

---

## Failure modes table

| Failure | Detection | Subagent action |
|---|---|---|
| capsule missing field | first-line check at procedure step 1 | return error JSON `{"error": "capsule_field_missing", "field": "<name>", "task_id": "<id>"}` |
| capsule file missing on disk | spawn-guard PreToolUse hook denies BEFORE subagent runs | (subagent never starts; orchestrator gets deny message and re-runs `pre-executor-check.py`) |
| typecheck fail | exit code != 0 from `${typecheck_cmd}` | return error JSON with `stderr` tail; DO NOT commit |
| build fail | exit code != 0 from `${build_cmd}` (when set) | return error JSON; DO NOT commit |
| multiple commits | R5 catches via `git log --oneline ${prev_sha}..HEAD \| wc -l > 1` (orchestrator post-spawn) | subagent should never produce multiple commits; if it does, returns error noting accidental split |
| binding missing in modified file | post-spawn output validator greps modified files for `// vg-binding:` markers | return error JSON listing unsatisfied bindings |
| design-ref read but no read-evidence written | post-spawn output validator: `design_ref_path` in input + `read_evidence_path` NULL in return | return error JSON `{"error": "design_evidence_missing", ...}` |
| commit-msg hook rejection (binding cite missing) | `git commit` exit code 1, hook stderr contains "binding" | return error JSON; orchestrator routes to gap-recovery |
| `subagent_type` typo in spawn | spawn-guard PreToolUse hook denies | (orchestrator sees deny; re-spawn with correct `vg-build-task-executor`) |
| `task_id` not in `remaining[]` | spawn-guard PreToolUse hook denies (Task 1, commit `6135701`) | (orchestrator sees deny; either typo in task_id or already spawned this task) |

---

## Validation by main agent on subagent return

The main agent (orchestrator) MUST validate the returned JSON before
marking the task complete. Per task:

- `task_id` matches the spawn input `task_id` exactly
- `commit_sha` resolves: `git rev-parse ${commit_sha}` exit code 0
- `bindings_satisfied` non-empty AND superset of `binding_requirements`
  required for this task
- `fingerprint_path` file exists on disk + non-empty
- `read_evidence_path` exists on disk IF `design_ref_path` was passed in
  input envelope; MUST be absent (or null in return) when `design_ref_path`
  was NULL
- `build_log_path` is present in return JSON (non-empty string), file
  exists on disk + non-empty, and resolves to
  `${PHASE_DIR}/BUILD-LOG/task-${task_id}.md` (per R1a UX baseline Req 1
  layer 1). Orchestrator MUST `[ -s "${build_log_path}" ]` before marking
  task complete; missing layer-1 split breaks post-executor's Layer 2/3
  aggregation (Task 11 concats every `BUILD-LOG/task-*.md` into the
  canonical `BUILD-LOG.md`).
- All `artifacts_written` paths exist on disk
- `commit_sha` appears in `git log ${WAVE_TAG}..HEAD` (i.e., the commit
  was made within this wave's range, not pre-existing)

If any check fails: do NOT mark task complete. Route to gap-recovery
via the orchestrator's standard re-dispatch path
(block-resolver L1 in `waves-overview.md` § 8d.1) before treating the
wave as failed.

The post-wave aggregation in `waves-overview.md` § 8d (R5 spawn plan
honor check, commit count audit, attribution audit, integrity
reconcile, UI-MAP injection audit, task-fidelity audit) provides the
secondary safety net — even if a subagent's return JSON looks valid,
the wave gates catch parallel-executor races, paraphrase, and
attribution corruption that single-task validation cannot see.

**Sandbox note (v2.68.0 C5):** Tests touching shared state (DB, ports, /tmp) should run in tempdir sandbox per `.claude/agents/vg-build-task-executor/SKILL.md` "Sandbox runtime" section.
