<rules>
1. **All pipeline artifacts required** — SPECS → CONTEXT → PLAN → API-CONTRACTS → TEST-GOALS → SUMMARY → RUNTIME-MAP → GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX → SANDBOX-TEST. Missing = BLOCK.
2. **Step markers mandatory** — every profile-applicable step from /vg:build, /vg:review, /vg:test MUST have its `.step-markers/{step}.done` file. Missing = BLOCK (AI skipped silently).
3. **SANDBOX-TEST verdict gate** — must be `PASSED` or `GAPS_FOUND`. `FAILED` → BLOCK with redirect.
4. **UAT is data-driven** — checklist items are GENERATED from VG artifacts (D-XX from CONTEXT, G-XX from TEST-GOALS, HIGH callers from RIPPLE-ANALYSIS, design-refs from PLAN). No hardcoded checks.
5. **No auto-accept** — every non-N/A item requires explicit user Pass/Fail/Skip.
6. **Ripple gate** — if RIPPLE-ANALYSIS has HIGH severity callers, user MUST acknowledge each before proceeding.
7. **Write UAT.md atomic** — at end, all results persisted. Rejected phase still writes UAT.md (audit trail).
8. **Zero hardcode** — all paths from `$REPO_ROOT`, `$PHASE_DIR`, `$PYTHON_BIN`, etc. resolved by config-loader.
</rules>

<objective>
Step 6 of V6 pipeline (final). Data-driven Human UAT over VG artifacts — not a generic GSD verify pass. User reviews each decision, goal, ripple, design ref explicitly.

Pipeline: specs → scope → blueprint → build → review → test → **accept**
</objective>

<process>

<step name="0_load_config">
Follow `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md`.

Resolves: `$REPO_ROOT`, `$PYTHON_BIN`, `$VG_TMP`, `$GRAPHIFY_GRAPH_PATH`, `$GRAPHIFY_ACTIVE`, `$PROFILE` (from config).

Parse first positional argument → `PHASE_ARG`.
```bash
PHASE_ARG="${1:-}"
if [ -z "$PHASE_ARG" ]; then
  echo "⛔ Phase number required. Usage: /vg:accept <phase>"
  exit 1
fi

# Locate phase dir (handles both "7.6" and "07.6")

</step>

<step name="4_build_uat_checklist">
**Build data-driven UAT checklist from VG artifacts.**

The checklist has 5 sections. Each section pulls directly from phase data — no hardcoded items.

### Section A: Decisions (from CONTEXT.md)

Parse `CONTEXT.md` for `D-XX` blocks. Each becomes a UAT item: "Was decision D-XX implemented as specified?"

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-decisions.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
text = Path("${PHASE_DIR}/CONTEXT.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
# Match D-XX heading + first descriptive line
for m in re.finditer(r'^##?\s*(D-\d+)[:\s-]+([^\n]+)', text, re.MULTILINE):
    did = m.group(1)
    title = m.group(2).strip().rstrip('*').strip()[:100]
    print(f"{did}\t{title}")
PY
```

### Section B: Goals (from TEST-GOALS.md + GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md)

Parse goals + their coverage status. Items: "Goal G-XX verified working?" for each READY goal. BLOCKED/UNREACHABLE goals flagged as known gaps.

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-goals.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
goals_text = Path("${PHASE_DIR}/TEST-GOALS.md").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
coverage_path = Path("${PHASE_DIR}/GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md")
coverage = coverage_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8") if coverage_path.exists() else ""

for m in re.finditer(r'^##?\s*(G-\d+)[:\s-]+([^\n]+)', goals_text, re.MULTILINE):
    gid = m.group(1)
    title = m.group(2).strip().rstrip('*').strip()[:100]
    # Look up status in coverage matrix (simple substring)
    status = "UNKNOWN"
    for line in coverage.splitlines():
        if gid in line:
            for tag in ("READY", "BLOCKED", "UNREACHABLE", "PARTIAL"):
                if tag in line.upper():
                    status = tag
                    break
            break
    print(f"{gid}\t{status}\t{title}")
PY
```

### Section C: Ripple acknowledgment (from RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md or .ripple.json)

If ripple data exists, HIGH-severity callers need explicit acknowledgment.

```bash
RIPPLE_JSON="${PHASE_DIR}/.ripple.json"
RIPPLE_MD="${PHASE_DIR}/RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md"

if [ -f "$RIPPLE_JSON" ]; then
  ${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-ripples.txt"
import json
from pathlib import Path
d = json.loads(Path("$RIPPLE_JSON").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
count = 0
for r in d.get("ripples", []):
    for c in r.get("callers", []):
        # Print one line per unique caller (dedup in bash later)
        print(f"{c['file']}:{c.get('line','?')}\t{c.get('symbol','?')}\t{r['changed_file']}")
        count += 1
print(f"# TOTAL_CALLERS={count}", flush=True)
PY
elif [ -f "$RIPPLE_MD" ]; then
  # Check if RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md is a "SKIPPED" stub (graphify was unavailable)
  if grep -qi "SKIPPED\|unavailable\|not available\|stub" "$RIPPLE_MD" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "# RIPPLE_SKIPPED=true" > "${VG_TMP}/uat-ripples.txt"
  else
    : > "${VG_TMP}/uat-ripples.txt"
  fi
else
  # No ripple data at all — no gate
  : > "${VG_TMP}/uat-ripples.txt"
fi
```

### Section D: Design fidelity (if phase has <design-ref>)

Extract <design-ref> attributes from PLAN tasks. Each becomes a spot-check item.
For mobile profiles, ALSO emit simulator/emulator screenshots captured during
`phase2_mobile_discovery` — each screenshot is a "built output" candidate to
visually compare against the design-ref.

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-designs.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
for plan in Path("${PHASE_DIR}").glob("*PLAN*.md"):
    text = plan.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    for m in re.finditer(r'<design-ref>([^<]+)</design-ref>', text):
        ref = m.group(1).strip()
        # ref format like "sites-list.default" or "sites-list.modal-add"
        print(ref)
PY
# Dedupe
sort -u "${VG_TMP}/uat-designs.txt" -o "${VG_TMP}/uat-designs.txt"

# Mobile-only: collect simulator/emulator screenshots from phase2_mobile_discovery.
# These sit in ${PHASE_DIR}/discover/ and are named like "G-XX-ios.png", "G-XX-android.png".
# We write them to uat-mobile-screenshots.txt — interactive step shows path so user
# opens file manager to compare vs design-normalized ref.
: > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-screenshots.txt"
case "$PROFILE" in
  mobile-*)
    if [ -d "${PHASE_DIR}/discover" ]; then
      find "${PHASE_DIR}/discover" -maxdepth 2 -type f \
        \( -name '*.png' -o -name '*.jpg' -o -name '*.jpeg' \) 2>/dev/null \
        | sort > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-screenshots.txt"
    fi
    ;;
esac

### Section E: Deliverables summary (from SUMMARY*.md — for spot-check only)

High-level summary of what was built — presented to user as context, not gated.

```bash
${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-summary.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
for summary in sorted(Path("${PHASE_DIR}").glob("*SUMMARY*.md")):
    text = summary.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
    # Extract "## Task N — title" or similar
    for m in re.finditer(r'^##?\s*(Task\s+\d+|Deliverable\s*\d+)[:\s-]+([^\n]+)', text, re.MULTILINE):
        title = m.group(2).strip().rstrip('*').strip()[:100]
        print(f"{summary.name}\t{m.group(1)}\t{title}")
PY
```

### Section F: Mobile gates (mobile profiles only)

Parse `build-state.log` for `mobile-gate-N: <name> status=<passed|failed|skipped> [reason=...] ts=...`
lines. Each gate becomes an acknowledgment row: user confirms the outcome makes
sense (e.g., "Gate 7 skipped because signing certs not yet provisioned — OK").

For web profiles this file stays empty and Section F is suppressed.

```bash
: > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-gates.txt"
case "$PROFILE" in
  mobile-*)
    BUILD_LOG="${PHASE_DIR}/build-state.log"
    if [ -f "$BUILD_LOG" ]; then
      ${PYTHON_BIN} - <<PY > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-gates.txt"
import re
from pathlib import Path
log = Path("${BUILD_LOG}").read_text(encoding="utf-8")
# Keep only the last entry per gate id — later runs overwrite earlier ones.
latest = {}
for m in re.finditer(r'mobile-gate-(\d+):\s*([a-z_]+)\s+status=(\w+)(?:\s+reason=([^\s]+))?\s*(?:ts=(\S+))?', log):
    gid, name, status, reason, ts = m.group(1), m.group(2), m.group(3), m.group(4) or '', m.group(5) or ''
    latest[gid] = (name, status, reason, ts)
# Emit in gate-id order (6,7,8,9,10)
for gid in sorted(latest.keys(), key=int):
    name, status, reason, ts = latest[gid]
    print(f"G{gid}\t{name}\t{status}\t{reason}\t{ts}")
PY
    fi
    ;;
esac

# Also collect mobile security audit findings if present (from /vg:test step 5f_mobile_security_audit)
: > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-security.txt"
case "$PROFILE" in
  mobile-*)
    SEC_REPORT="${PHASE_DIR}/mobile-security/report.md"
    if [ -f "$SEC_REPORT" ]; then
      # Surface the summary counts only (details live in the report file)
      grep -E "^(CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW)\|" "$SEC_REPORT" > "${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-security.txt" 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
    ;;
esac
```

**Now present SECTION COUNTS to user:**
```
UAT Checklist for Phase {PHASE_NUMBER}:
  Section A — Decisions (CONTEXT D-XX):     {count} items
  Section B — Goals (TEST-GOALS G-XX):      {count} items
  Section C — Ripple callers (HIGH):        {count} callers need acknowledgment
  Section D — Design refs:                  {count} refs + {mobile_count} simulator shots
  Section E — Deliverables (summary):       {count} tasks
  Section F — Mobile gates (mobile only):   {count} gate rows + {N} sec findings  [OMITTED for web]
  Test verdict:                              {VERDICT from Gate 3}

Proceed with UAT? (y/n/abort)
```

If user aborts → stop, write UAT.md with status `ABORTED`.
</step>

<step name="5_interactive_uat">
**Run interactive checklist — one item at a time.**

For each section:

### A. Decisions
For each line in `${VG_TMP}/uat-decisions.txt`:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Decision {D-XX}: {title}
   Was this implemented as specified in CONTEXT.md?

   [p] Pass — verified in code/runtime
   [f] Fail — not implemented correctly (note the issue)
   [s] Skip — cannot verify right now (deferred)"
```

### B. Goals
For each line in `${VG_TMP}/uat-goals.txt` where status = READY:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Goal {G-XX}: {title}   [STATUS: READY per coverage matrix]
   Verified working in runtime?

   [p] Pass — functions as TEST-GOALS.md success criteria
   [f] Fail — doesn't work / wrong behavior
   [s] Skip — not testable here (deferred)"
```

For BLOCKED/UNREACHABLE goals: show info block, no question asked:
```
  ⚠ Goal {G-XX}: {title}   [STATUS: BLOCKED/UNREACHABLE]
      Known gap — not gated here. Address in next phase or /vg:build --gaps-only.
```

### C. Ripple acknowledgment (MANDATORY if any HIGH callers)

**If `uat-ripples.txt` contains `RIPPLE_SKIPPED=true`** (graphify was unavailable):
```
⚠ Cross-module ripple analysis was SKIPPED (graphify unavailable during review).
  Downstream callers of changed symbols were NOT checked.
  Manual regression testing of affected modules is strongly advised.

  [y] Acknowledged — I will manually verify affected modules
  [s] Accept risk — proceed without ripple verification (recorded in UAT.md)
  [n] Abort — need to enable graphify and re-run /vg:review first
```

**Otherwise**, present the list, ask single acknowledgment question:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Ripple callers (HIGH severity) that were NOT updated in this phase:

   [list first 10, + '... and N more' if > 10]

   Each should have been manually reviewed or explicitly cited.
   Have you verified these callers still work with the changed symbols?

   [y] Yes — verified (per RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md + code review)
   [n] No — need to review before accepting (ABORT UAT)
   [s] Skip — accept risk (record in UAT.md)"
```

If `n` → abort UAT, write UAT.md status = `DEFERRED_PENDING_RIPPLE_REVIEW`.

### D. Design fidelity (if design refs exist)
For each unique design-ref in `${VG_TMP}/uat-designs.txt`:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Design ref: {ref}
   Screenshot: .planning/design-normalized/screenshots/{ref}.png (or similar)
   Built output matches screenshot (layout, spacing, components)?

   [p] Pass — visual match
   [f] Fail — significant drift (describe)
   [s] Skip — no design ref available / cannot verify"
```

**Mobile extension** (runs ONLY when `$PROFILE` matches `mobile-*`):
For each simulator/emulator screenshot in `${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-screenshots.txt`:
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Simulator capture: {path}
   Captured by /vg:review phase2_mobile_discovery. Compare against closest
   design-ref (above) — does the running app match the intended layout?

   [p] Pass — visual match vs design-ref
   [f] Fail — drift (typography, color, spacing, or content off)
   [s] Skip — no matching design-ref to compare against"
```
If no screenshots exist (host lacked simulator/emulator), inform user:
```
  ⚠ No mobile screenshots captured — host OS/tooling could not run simulator/emulator.
    Section D mobile sub-checks skipped (expected on Windows for iOS).
```

### E. Deliverables (informational only — no per-item question)
Present `${VG_TMP}/uat-summary.txt` as a final summary block. No questions.

### F. Mobile gates (mobile profiles only — skipped for web)

Present the gate table from `${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-gates.txt`. Example:
```
  G6  permission_audit        passed
  G7  cert_expiry             skipped (disabled)
  G8  privacy_manifest        passed
  G9  native_module_linking   skipped (no-tool)
  G10 bundle_size             passed
```

Plus security audit findings (if any) from `${VG_TMP}/uat-mobile-security.txt`:
```
  CRITICAL|hardcoded_secrets|3 match(es) — see mobile-security/hardcoded-secrets.txt
  MEDIUM|weak_crypto|1 MD5 usage — see mobile-security/weak-crypto.txt
```

```
AskUserQuestion (once, covers entire Section F):
  "Mobile gate outcomes look correct for this phase?
   (e.g. 'cert_expiry skipped because no signing yet' = OK if pre-release;
    'hardcoded_secrets=3' requires explanation before accept)

   [y] Acknowledged — outcomes match phase intent
   [n] Not OK — gate output points to an actual issue (ABORT / REJECT)
   [s] Skip — accept risk (record in UAT.md)"
```

If `n` → abort UAT, set phase verdict = REJECTED with reason `mobile-gate-review-fail`.

After all sections, present totals:
```
UAT Progress:
  Decisions (A):     {N} passed / {N} failed / {N} skipped
  Goals (B):         {N} passed / {N} failed / {N} skipped (+ {N} known gaps)
  Ripples (C):       {acknowledged | abort | accepted-risk}
  Designs (D):       {N} passed / {N} failed / {N} skipped  ({Nmob} mobile screenshots)
  Mobile gates (F):  {acknowledged | rejected | risk-accepted}  [only for mobile-*]
```

### Final verdict question
```
AskUserQuestion:
  "Overall phase verdict?

   [a] ACCEPT — phase complete (all critical items pass)
   [r] REJECT — issues found, need /vg:build --gaps-only
   [d] DEFER — partial accept, revisit later (record open items)"
```

Record all responses with timestamps in orchestrator memory for step 6.

Reviewer acknowledgment: {ACK / REJECT / RISK-ACCEPTED}

## Issues Found
{bulleted list of FAIL items across all sections, or "None"}

## Overall Summary
- Total items: {N_total}
- Passed: {N_passed}
- Failed: {N_failed}
- Skipped/deferred: {N_skipped}
- Known pre-existing gaps (not gated): {N_gaps}

## Next Step
{
  ACCEPTED: "Phase complete. Run /vg:next or proceed to next phase.",
  REJECTED: "Address failed items via /vg:build ${PHASE_NUMBER} --gaps-only, then re-run /vg:test + /vg:accept.",
  DEFERRED: "Partial accept — open items: {list}. Revisit with /vg:accept ${PHASE_NUMBER} --resume."

### If ACCEPTED

**Cleanup scan intermediates** (large JSON files from review, not needed after accept):
```bash
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/scan-*.json
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/probe-*.json
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/nav-discovery.json
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/discovery-state.json
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/view-assignments.json
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/element-counts.json
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/.ripple-input.txt
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/.ripple.json     # aggregated into UAT.md
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/.callers.json    # served its purpose during build
rm -f "${PHASE_DIR}"/.god-nodes.json
rm -rf "${PHASE_DIR}"/.wave-context
rm -rf "${PHASE_DIR}"/.wave-tasks

# Keep: SPECS, CONTEXT, PLAN*, API-CONTRACTS, TEST-GOALS, SUMMARY*,
#       RUNTIME-MAP.json, GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md, SANDBOX-TEST.md,
#       RIPPLE-ANALYSIS.md, UAT.md, .step-markers/
```

**Cleanup root-leaked screenshots** (banned location per project convention):
```bash
rm -f ./${PHASE_NUMBER}-*.png 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Prune git worktrees + playwright locks**:
```bash
git worktree prune 2>/dev/null || true
[ -x "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" ] && \
  bash "${HOME}/.claude/playwright-locks/playwright-lock.sh" cleanup 0 all 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Update VG-native state:**
```bash
# VG-native state update (no GSD dependency)
PIPELINE_STATE="${PHASE_DIR}/PIPELINE-STATE.json"
${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
import json; from pathlib import Path
p = Path('${PIPELINE_STATE}')
s = json.loads(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8')) if p.exists() else {}
s['status'] = 'complete'; s['pipeline_step'] = 'accepted'
s['updated_at'] = __import__('datetime').datetime.now().isoformat()
p.write_text(json.dumps(s, indent=2))
" 2>/dev/null

# VG-native ROADMAP update (grep + sed)
if [ -f ".planning/ROADMAP.md" ]; then
  sed -i "s/\*\*Status:\*\* .*/\*\*Status:\*\* complete/" ".planning/ROADMAP.md" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

**Commit UAT.md**:
```bash
git add "${PHASE_DIR}/${PHASE_NUMBER}-UAT.md" "${PHASE_DIR}/.step-markers/accept.done"
git commit -m "docs(${PHASE_NUMBER}-accept): UAT accepted — {N_passed}/{N_total} items pass

Covers goal: accept phase ${PHASE_NUMBER}"
```

Display:
```
Phase {PHASE_NUMBER} ACCEPTED ✓
Artifacts preserved: SPECS, CONTEXT, PLAN, API-CONTRACTS, TEST-GOALS, SUMMARY,
                     RUNTIME-MAP, GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX, SANDBOX-TEST, RIPPLE-ANALYSIS, UAT
Cleaned: scan-*.json, probe-*.json, .wave-context, discovery intermediates
State: GSD roadmap updated (if installed)
▶ /vg:next
```

### If REJECTED

Extract failed items from UAT.md per section into a gap list. Suggest next step:
```
Phase {PHASE_NUMBER} REJECTED — {N_failed} issues.

Failed items:
  [A] Decisions: {list of failed D-XX}
  [B] Goals:     {list of failed G-XX}
  [C] Ripples:   {if deferred}
  [D] Designs:   {list of failed refs}

Next: /vg:build ${PHASE_NUMBER} --gaps-only  (auto-creates gap-closure plans from UAT.md FAIL items)
      Then: /vg:test ${PHASE_NUMBER} → /vg:accept ${PHASE_NUMBER}
```

### If DEFERRED

```bash
# ⛔ HARD GATE (tightened 2026-04-17): DEFERRED marks phase incomplete.
# /vg:next must BLOCK until these items are resolved — previously DEFERRED silently
# allowed next phase to start, compounding tech debt.
PIPELINE_STATE="${PHASE_DIR}/PIPELINE-STATE.json"
${PYTHON_BIN} -c "
import json; from pathlib import Path
p = Path('${PIPELINE_STATE}')
s = json.loads(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8')) if p.exists() else {}
s['status'] = 'deferred-incomplete'
s['deferred_at'] = __import__('datetime').datetime.now().isoformat()
s['deferred_items_count'] = ${N_failed:-0}
p.write_text(json.dumps(s, indent=2))
"
touch "${PHASE_DIR}/.deferred-incomplete"
```

```
Phase {PHASE_NUMBER} DEFERRED — partial accept.

⛔ /vg:next is BLOCKED for this phase until deferred items resolved.
   Open items recorded in UAT.md ({N_failed} FAIL items).
   
Resume with: /vg:accept ${PHASE_NUMBER} --resume  (reopens deferred items only)
Force-advance (NOT RECOMMENDED): /vg:next --allow-deferred
```
</step>

</process>

<success_criteria>
- All artifacts + step markers verified BEFORE UAT starts
- Checklist items generated FROM VG data (not hardcoded)
- Every D-XX, G-XX (READY), HIGH-ripple caller, design-ref addressed by user
- UAT.md written atomically with structured pass/fail/skip per section
- If ACCEPTED: cleanup + commit + state update
- If REJECTED: clear gap list pointing to /vg:build --gaps-only
- No dependency on GSD verify-work (VG-native)
- **Mobile (mobile-*) only**: Section D iterates simulator captures from
  `${PHASE_DIR}/discover/`; Section F presents gate outcomes parsed from
  `build-state.log` + security findings from `mobile-security/report.md`.
  User acknowledgment of Section F is required — rejection aborts UAT.
- **Cross-platform portability**: all paths are config-relative; no
  hardcoded device names, sim names, team IDs, or OS-specific commands.
