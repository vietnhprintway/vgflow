# /vg:learn

User gate for bootstrap overlay changes. Primary entry point: **end-of-step reflection** auto-drafts candidates into `.vg/bootstrap/CANDIDATES.md`. This command reviews them.

## Load config

Read `.claude/commands/vg/_shared/config-loader.md` first. Sets `${PLANNING_DIR}`, `${PYTHON_BIN}`, etc.

## Subcommands

### `/vg:learn --review [id]`

List pending candidates. With `<id>`, show full evidence + dry-run preview.

**Without `<id>`** — list all:
```bash
# Candidates are fenced ```yaml blocks starting with `id: L-XXX` at column 0
# (top-level mapping, not list-style — list-style would collide with YAML
# sequence semantics inside the fence).
grep -nE '^id: L-' .vg/bootstrap/CANDIDATES.md | head -20
```

For each candidate, show: id, title, type, scope, confidence, created_at.

**With `<id>`** — show full detail:
1. Parse candidate block from `.vg/bootstrap/CANDIDATES.md`
2. Show all evidence entries (file:line, user message, telemetry event_id)
3. **Dry-run preview:**
   - For `config_override`: diff current vanilla config vs proposed
   - For `rule`: evaluate scope against last 10 phases, report which would have matched
   - Impact: "rule would fire in N future phases with current metadata"
   - Conflict check: list any active ACCEPTED rules with overlapping scope + opposite action

Display with mandatory confirm prompt:
```
Promote? [y/n/edit]
```

### `/vg:learn --promote <id>`

Apply candidate to bootstrap zone.

**MANDATORY pre-check:**
1. Schema validate (for `config_override`): target key must be in `schema/overlay.schema.yml` allowlist
   - If not in allowlist → offer fallback: "convert to prose rule?"
2. Scope syntax validate via `scope-evaluator.py --context-json <empty> --scope-json <scope>` → exit 2 = malformed
3. **Conflict detect** vs active ACCEPTED rules (same target key, opposite value/action) — MUST call `bootstrap-conflict.py`:
   ```bash
   # Write candidate block to tempfile then call conflict detector
   CAND_YAML=$(mktemp -t vg-candidate-XXXXXX.yml)
   # AI extracts candidate YAML block from CANDIDATES.md for L-XXX into $CAND_YAML
   RESULT=$("${PYTHON_BIN:-python3}" .claude/scripts/bootstrap-conflict.py \
     --candidate "$CAND_YAML" --emit json)
   CONFLICT_RC=$?
   rm -f "$CAND_YAML"
   if [ "$CONFLICT_RC" -ne 0 ]; then
     echo "⛔ Conflict detected — cannot promote L-XXX:" >&2
     echo "$RESULT" | ${PYTHON_BIN:-python3} -c "import json,sys; [print(f'  - {c}') for c in json.load(sys.stdin).get('conflicts', [])]"
     echo "   Resolve: retract conflicting rule OR adjust candidate scope." >&2
     exit 1
   fi
   ```
4. Dedupe check vs ACCEPTED (semantic equivalence) → block if duplicate
5. Dry-run REQUIRED (shows impact preview)

**If all pass:**
1. For `config_override` → update `.vg/bootstrap/overlay.yml` (deep-merge)
2. For `rule` → write `.vg/bootstrap/rules/{slug-from-title}.md` with full frontmatter
3. For `patch` → write `.vg/bootstrap/patches/{command}.{anchor}.md`, validate anchor in `anchors.yml`
4. Remove candidate from `CANDIDATES.md`
5. Append to `ACCEPTED.md` with git_sha placeholder
6. **Git commit atomic:**
   ```
   chore(bootstrap): promote L-XXX — {reason}

   Type: {type}
   Target: {target}
   Origin: {origin_incident or user.lesson}
   Confidence: {confidence}
   ```
7. Update ACCEPTED.md entry with real SHA
8. Emit telemetry:
   ```
   emit_telemetry "bootstrap.candidate_promoted" PASS \
     "{\"id\":\"L-XXX\",\"type\":\"...\",\"target\":\"...\"}"
   ```

### `/vg:learn --reject <id> --reason "..."`

Decline candidate. Reason is REQUIRED (prevents silent dismissal).

1. Move candidate block from `CANDIDATES.md` to `REJECTED.md`
2. Append rejection metadata: user, timestamp, reason, dedupe_key
3. Emit telemetry `bootstrap.candidate_rejected`

Reflector checks `REJECTED.md` dedupe_key before future drafts — 2+ rejects of same key → silent skip forever.

### `/vg:learn --retract <id> --reason "..."`

**Emergency rollback** — remove an ACCEPTED rule immediately. Reason REQUIRED.

Use when:
- Rule caused regression discovered after promote
- Rule obsolete after refactor
- Manual cleanup

1. Locate rule in bootstrap zone (overlay.yml key / rules/*.md / patches/*.md)
2. Remove / set status=retracted
3. Append to `RETRACTED.md` with stats snapshot (hits, success/fail counts)
4. Git commit atomic:
   ```
   chore(bootstrap): retract L-XXX — {reason}
   ```
5. Emit `bootstrap.rule_retracted` telemetry

## Interactive inline-edit (`e` option during --review)

Not an external editor — prompt loop:
```
Editing L-042:
  [1] title:    "Playwright required for UI phases"
  [2] scope:    any_of: [...]
  [3] action:   must_run
  [4] prose:    "..."
  [5] target_step: review
  [done] finish editing

Field to edit? [1/2/3/4/5/done]: _
```

User picks field, inline-prompt shows current value, user types new value, save.
When `done` → re-validate schema + scope syntax, then proceed to promote.

## Output

- `--review` → terminal listing + optional full-detail block
- `--promote/--reject/--retract` → confirmation message + git SHA

## Safety

- Every promote = 1 git commit (atomic, revertable)
- Every reject has reason (REJECTED.md audit)
- Every retract has reason + stats snapshot (RETRACTED.md audit)
- Schema validation blocks AI invent fake keys
- Conflict detection blocks incompatible rules
- Dedupe blocks redundant rules
- Dry-run mandatory — no way to promote without seeing impact preview first
