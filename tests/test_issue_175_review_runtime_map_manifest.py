"""
Regression test for issue #175 — vg:review must auto-record evidence-manifest
entries for BOTH RUNTIME-MAP.json and GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md.

Original gap: review fix-loop emitted manifest for GOAL-COVERAGE-MATRIX.md only.
RUNTIME-MAP.json was written by step 2b-3 but never recorded → run-complete
blocked because must_write artifacts existed on disk without manifest entries.

Fix: fix-loop-and-goals.md now emits manifest entries for both files at Phase 4.
