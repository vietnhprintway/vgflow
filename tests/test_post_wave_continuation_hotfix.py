"""Regression test for v4.21.0 hotfix — post-wave continuation enforcement.

Real-world dogfood feedback (PrintwayV3 Phase 7 Wave 14):
- Build waves completed but AI ended turn before running STEP 5 post-execution.
- vg-build-post-executor never spawned → L2/L3/L5/L6 fidelity gates skipped.
- truthcheck never ran → no truthcheck.json artifact.
- User re-ran /vg:build → preflight blocked with stale markers error,
  suggested --reset-queue (DESTRUCTIVE — wipes wave commits) instead of
  --resume (correct).

Two fixes ship in v4.21.0:

1. **scripts/hooks/vg-stop.sh** — new check #4: when build command + waves
   done + 9_post_execution missing + is_final_wave=true → BLOCK Stop hook
   with POST-WAVE CONTINUATION failure. AI cannot end turn without
   completing STEP 5.

2. **commands/vg/_shared/build/preflight.md** — Step 2 marker sanity check
   now detects partial-build-state. When waves done + 9_post_execution
   missing, suggests --resume (continue) NOT --reset-queue (destroy).
